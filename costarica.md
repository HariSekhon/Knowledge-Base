## Summary

Costa Rica uses their own currency the Colón (plural: Colones),
but you can often also give US dollars to taxi drivers or accommodation.

Most places take card, except for InDrive and street food places, so you probably don't need to withdraw that much.

## Immigration Control & Exit Flights

I was actually asked for the date of my outbound flight as well as where I'm staying.

The airline Avianca refused to let me do a baggage drop without first booking an outbound flight.

## Taxi Apps

- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/cr/en/)
- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/en-cr) - usually cheaper than Uber, but often requires cash
- [DiDi](https://web.didiglobal.com/cr/) - didn't receive their SMS verification so didn't try it

## San Jose

The capital.

You probably want to stay somewhere between [Sabana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/y2Sm4ZYYDzm5WpRH6) and
[San José Central Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bNJmG9t3UDfriwdD8).

<!--

[Stray Cat Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/R1dcBURToEvgwukF7) - good wifi speed, 176/7 Mbit/s, trendy, and has
3 cats, 2 black ones, but has a max age limit of 42 for dorms

-->

### Attractions in San Jose

- [Central Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Av313U4s39NAPZXW9) - you can spend 2 hours just browsing the stalls,
  especially as the layout is not a clear grid matrix, so I ended up going round in circles trying to cover all the
  alleys
- [Parque Morazán](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z2Jmx6KRTa626GB6A)
- [Sabana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UC9hMnUFxtuqFBnf9) - large park in central west
- [National Museum of Costa Rica](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Lp2PLazjAg4tnVm3A)
- [National Theatre of Costa Rica](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mZLLiTRy8dx7tgT66)
- [Jade Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yGoQSNrvVJECPVfs6)
- [Pre-Columbian Gold Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UV25YtaUz24YkQ7bA)
- [Metropolitan Cathedral of San José](https://maps.app.goo.gl/i1d49q79p2i5hjDk7)
- [Costa Rican Art Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vmEcLoF6JNrras516)

### Restaurants in San Jose

- [Central Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Av313U4s39NAPZXW9) - get here before 5pm and get some street food, it's the
  difference between paying 3,000-5,000 CRC (\$10) vs paying 10,000-20,000 CRC (\$20-\$40) elsewhere
  - [Marisquería La Ribera](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bxW6HwZNV6nR174w9) - affordable seafood place in the central market.
    The seafood soup is good, and the combos are good food value at 3500 for a fish fillet, rice with seafood, nachos, salad and a
    drink. I don’t know what that drink was but it was tasty and looked like it had herbs in it, and definitely a little
    sugar to taste so good.
    The strawberry milkshake for 1400 was worth it too, just the right amount of sweetness
- [Mexicanito Sport Bar y Restaurante](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oqg8ZbebzopgbXS39) - cheap local eats bar, the cascados
  with bistek (steak) was good for the price, and comes with rice, plantain, salad, frijoles beans and potato cubes.
  Has wifi
- [Restaurante Parrilla al Carbon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4pXEBQFJHbYpHaPDA) - the 400g strip steak was succulent and
  very seasoned with rock salt and some yellow thing. It had a little gristle around it but not too much.
  The plantain split with cheese in the middle was great, I wish there was more of it.
  I tried to get their creole potatoes but they didn’t have them so settled for mashed potatoes which was nowhere near
  as good as mine, next time stick to fries.
  The strawberry smoothie with milk had just the right amount of sweetness.

## Manuel Antonio

[Manuel Antonio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/j1XxALwELfSbac9r5) and [Quepos](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6j1SQ1fTHdCFD1PX9) are
beach towns about 4 hours drive away from San Jose.

### Travel to Manuel Antonio

You can catch a bus from [Bus Terminal - Tracopa Ltda](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RKsNDJx1kv9oof6g6).

This costs around \$10-\$12 and takes around 4.5 hours with a 20 minute stopover for a toilet break.

### Attractions in Manuel Antonio

You can catch the bus at bus stops for 370 CRC (< \$1).

- [Playa Manuel Antonio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UdyJiFD2idrhaFzj6) /
  [Espadilla Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FdupjPH86Wz7heSAA) -
  long lovely sand beach with shallow shore and great sunset
- [Manuel Antonio National Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/S356vnztJtWyeGXt5)

### Restaurants in Manuel Antonio

<!--

Planet B hostel is decent, especially for the price, but it's bit closer to the Quepos town.
Wifi 5/9 Mbit/s, but sketchy in the kitchen but more reliable on the level above.

-->

Undecided:

- [Restaurante Mimositico](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qCWfnJXfVmNvEpLG6) - bistec cascado was overcooked and tough. I had
  to ask for a sharper knife to be able to cut it and then cut it into tiny pieces to be able to actually eat it.
  The bistec was also relatively small part of the place compared to other cascados I’ve had in Costa Rica.
  The strawberry shake with milk was good, but smaller than others I had the last couple days.
  Did not deserve a 4.9 rating, but perhaps it needs another try.
  WiFi 20/25 Mbit/s

Not Recommended:

- [Luna Llena Collectiv Art Cafe Boutique](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LCb7hifEXheV1T6j9) - highly rated, nice ambience and
  shop mainly targetting women's garments and trinkets, but \$12 for a ham and cheese panini, tourist priced.
  I was still hungry after it and had to eat again

## Quepos

Seaside town up the road from Manuel Antonio with various restaurants.

- [Sabromar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9mTsn3YNhYxyAMce9) - don't let the empty downstairs fast food restaurant look fool
  you, the upstairs was packed with people, a nice restaurant and food, with a gift shop at the reception.
  The shrimp ceviche was decent, although the strawberry milkshake was a decent size, it wasn't as good as other places.
  Wifi 126/93 Mbit/s
