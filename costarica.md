## Summary

Cost Rica uses their own currency the Colón (plural: Colones),
but you can often also give US dollars to taxi drivers or accommodation.

Most places take card, except for InDrive and street food places, so you probably don't need to withdraw that much.

## Immigration Control & Exit Flights

I was actually asked for the date of my outbound flight as well as where I'm staying.

The airline Avianca refused to let me do a baggage drop without first booking an outbound flight.

## Taxi Apps

- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/cr/en/)
- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/en-cr) - usually cheaper than Uber
- [DiDi](https://web.didiglobal.com/cr/) - didn't receive their SMS verification so didn't try it

## San Jose

The capital.

You probably want to stay somewhere between [Sabana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/y2Sm4ZYYDzm5WpRH6) and
[San José Central Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bNJmG9t3UDfriwdD8).

### Attractions in San Jose

- [Central Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Av313U4s39NAPZXW9) - you can spend 2 hours just browsing the stalls,
  especially as the layout is not a clear grid matrix, so I ended up going round in circles trying to cover all the
  alleys
- [Parque Morazán](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z2Jmx6KRTa626GB6A)
- [Sabana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UC9hMnUFxtuqFBnf9) - large park in central west
- [National Museum of Costa Rica](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Lp2PLazjAg4tnVm3A)
- [National Theatre of Costa Rica](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mZLLiTRy8dx7tgT66)
- [Jade Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yGoQSNrvVJECPVfs6)

### Restaurants in San Jose

- [Central Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Av313U4s39NAPZXW9) - get here before 5pm and get some street food, it's the
  difference between paying 3,000-5,000 CRC (\$10) vs paying 10,000-20,000 CRC (\$20-\$40) elsewhere
- [Restaurante Parrilla al Carbon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4pXEBQFJHbYpHaPDA) - the 400g strip steak was succulent and
  very seasoned with rock salt and some yellow thing. It had a little gristle around it but not too much.
  The plantain split with cheese in the middle was great, I wish there was more of it.
  I tried to get their creole potatoes but they didn’t have them so settled for mashed potatoes which was nowhere near
  as good as mine, next time stick to fries.
  The strawberry smoothie with milk had just the right amount of sweetness.
