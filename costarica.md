## Summary

_"Expensive"_ - the first word I hear when I ask other tourists here about how they are finding Costa Rica.

_"Muy Caro"_ (translation: _"very expensive"_) when I ask locals about Costa Rica.

When I asked locals why this is since it doesn't seem justified,
they said it's because they get a lot of American tourists, so they've put American prices.

Costa Rica uses their own currency the Colón (plural: Colones),
but you can often also give US dollars to taxi drivers or accommodation.

Most places take card, except for InDrive and street food places, so you probably don't need to withdraw that much, and
there are ATMs without fees below.

The food is also average at best in most places I've tried.
Many places will charge you 13% tax on top of the menu price and another 10%+ service charge on top too,
so factor that in to your costs.

I recommend shortening your stay and going straight to the nature reserves and beaches like Manuel Antonio with maximum
one night stopover in San Jose if you need it.

Overall, at these prices, I would not re-visit Costa Rica unless I really wanted to go see the nature
(there are good beaches all over the world and anybody can build ziplines).

## San Jose Airport

Most of the food places are past security.

You might want to eat and drink first though unless you enjoy paying \$5-\$9 for a bottle of water, \$14 for a sandwich,
or \$25 for a burger and fries (Dec 2025 prices).

There are free water refill stations past security so don't waste your money on bottled water, bring a reusable water
bottle.

Thankfully the immigration control and security are pretty quick
and don't have the big queues that you see in other bigger airports.

There is a large collection of gift shops past security full of costa rica branded clothes, toys and snacks.

There are charging stations with bar stool style desks for laptops and phones.

## Immigration Control - Exit Flight Required

I was actually asked for the date of my outbound flight as well as where I'm staying.

The airline Avianca in EL Salvador refused to let me do a baggage drop to get here without first booking an outbound
flight first.

## ATMs

- [National Bank ATM](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eB5yePY8Bny8C9RR9) - no local ATM fee for withdrawals.
  There is often quite a queue here (15-20 people), but it goes quickly as there are several ATMs inside
- [BCR (Banco de Costa Rica)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pTsrpDCZr43wyGpX8) - several ATMs without fees, but it rejected my
  card with some communications error, I then went to National Bank above

## Taxi Apps

- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/cr/en/)
- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/en-cr) - usually cheaper than Uber, but often requires cash - I paid in dollars for my
  first one since I didn't have local currency when coming from the airport
- [DiDi](https://web.didiglobal.com/cr/) - didn't receive their SMS verification so didn't try it

## San Jose

The capital.

You probably want to stay somewhere between [Sabana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/y2Sm4ZYYDzm5WpRH6) and
[San José Central Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bNJmG9t3UDfriwdD8).

### Attractions in San Jose

- [Central Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Av313U4s39NAPZXW9) - you can spend 2 hours just browsing the stalls,
  especially as the layout is not a clear grid matrix, so I ended up going round in circles trying to cover all the
  alleys
- [Parque Morazán](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z2Jmx6KRTa626GB6A)
- [Sabana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UC9hMnUFxtuqFBnf9) - large park in central west
- [National Museum of Costa Rica](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Lp2PLazjAg4tnVm3A)
- [National Theatre of Costa Rica](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mZLLiTRy8dx7tgT66)
- [Jade Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yGoQSNrvVJECPVfs6)
- [Pre-Columbian Gold Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UV25YtaUz24YkQ7bA)
- [Metropolitan Cathedral of San José](https://maps.app.goo.gl/i1d49q79p2i5hjDk7)
- [Costa Rican Art Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vmEcLoF6JNrras516)

### Restaurants in San Jose

<!--

[Stray Cat Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/R1dcBURToEvgwukF7) - good wifi speed, 176/7 Mbit/s, trendy, and has
3 cats, 2 black ones, but has a max age limit of 42 for dorms

[Costa Rica Backpackers](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gqPzu3uSXepRgtHcA) - cheap,
pool looks good, but the room itself was pretty poor - they must has spent all their money on th blue lights in the
pool.
Ok for a one night stopover in/out but that's all.
The kitchen stove is also a bit weak, but the on-site restaurant isn't bad,
the beef cascado was average like most places, but the fruit yoghurt granola breakfast was actually pretty good

-->

- [Central Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Av313U4s39NAPZXW9) - get here before 5pm and get some street food, it's the
  difference between paying 3,000-5,000 CRC (\$10) vs paying 10,000-20,000 CRC (\$20-\$40) elsewhere
  - [Marisquería La Ribera](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bxW6HwZNV6nR174w9) - affordable seafood place in the central market.
    The seafood soup is good, and the combos are good food value at 3500 for a fish fillet, rice with seafood, nachos, salad and a
    drink. I don’t know what that drink was but it was tasty and looked like it had herbs in it, and definitely a little
    sugar to taste so good.
    The strawberry milkshake for 1400 was worth it too, just the right amount of sweetness
- [Mexicanito Sport Bar y Restaurante](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oqg8ZbebzopgbXS39) - cheap local eats bar, the cascados
  with bistek (steak) was good for the price, and comes with rice, plantain, salad, frijoles beans and potato cubes.
  Has wifi
- [Restaurante Parrilla al Carbon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4pXEBQFJHbYpHaPDA) - the 400g strip steak was succulent and
  very seasoned with rock salt and some yellow thing. It had a little gristle around it but not too much.
  The plantain split with cheese in the middle was great, I wish there was more of it.
  I tried to get their creole potatoes but they didn’t have them so settled for mashed potatoes which was nowhere near
  as good as mine, next time stick to fries.
  The strawberry smoothie with milk had just the right amount of sweetness.
  WiFi 16/8 Mbit/s

## Manuel Antonio

[Manuel Antonio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/j1XxALwELfSbac9r5) and [Quepos](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6j1SQ1fTHdCFD1PX9) are
beach towns about 4 hours drive away from San Jose.

### Travel to Manuel Antonio

You can catch a bus from [Bus Terminal - Tracopa Ltda](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RKsNDJx1kv9oof6g6).

This costs around \$10-\$12 and takes around 4.5 hours with a 20 minute stopover for a toilet break.

### Attractions in Manuel Antonio

You can catch the bus at bus stops for 370 CRC (< \$1).

- [Playa Manuel Antonio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UdyJiFD2idrhaFzj6) /
  [Espadilla Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FdupjPH86Wz7heSAA) -
  long lovely sand beach with shallow shore and great sunset
- [Manuel Antonio National Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/S356vnztJtWyeGXt5) - rainforest nature reserve with animals
- [Sukia Park and Zip Line Tours](https://maps.app.goo.gl/onE3JRMZzp168BBG7)

### Restaurants in Manuel Antonio

<!--

Planet B hostel is decent, especially for the price, but it's bit closer to the Quepos town.
Wifi 5/9 Mbit/s, but sketchy in the kitchen but more reliable on the level above.

-->

Tourist priced throughout.

Undecided (mixed bag):

- [Restaurante Mimositico](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qCWfnJXfVmNvEpLG6) - bistec cascado was overcooked and tough. I had
  to ask for a sharper knife to be able to cut it and then cut it into tiny pieces to be able to actually eat it.
  The bistec was also relatively small part of the place compared to other cascados I’ve had in Costa Rica.
  The strawberry shake with milk was good, but smaller than others I had the last couple days.
  Did not deserve a 4.9 rating, but perhaps it needs another try.
  Restaurant was a bit dead, just a couple tourists from neighbouring accommodations.
  This is not a place locals seem likely to come.
  WiFi 20/25 Mbit/s
- [Bar las gemelas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/osaQS2qD1LgKiT8j8) - food wasn't terrible, nice sunset view, and it's one of
  the more reasonably priced places to eat at 4500 CRC for a beef casacado, but this is how they get you.
  When I ordered a strawberry en leche (with milk) ie.
  a milkshake for 2500 CRC (\$5), the waiter gave me the fattening syrup-y 3500 CRC (\$7) ice cream one
  instead, likely on purpose since their service charge is an automatic percentage

Not Recommended:

- [Luna Llena Collectiv Art Cafe Boutique](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LCb7hifEXheV1T6j9) - highly rated, nice ambience and
  shop mainly targetting women's garments and trinkets, but \$12 for a ham and cheese panini, tourist priced.
  I was still hungry after it and had to eat again

TODO:

- [Terraza By Issimo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qFWcNgZ8jLhbvA8z7) - 4.8
- [Arbol. Food & Wine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zwcDvAgoarpFqtZ48) - 4.8
- [Terraza 77 Restaurant y Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xxTLnCzJb9XAvYGg6) - 4.6
- [Agua Azul](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Km93RxUymUDCJFVX7) - 4.6

## Quepos

Seaside town up the road from Manuel Antonio with various restaurants.

- [Sabromar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9mTsn3YNhYxyAMce9) - don't let the empty downstairs fast food restaurant look fool
  you, the upstairs was packed with locals, unlike the Restaurante Mimositico I went to first.
  The upstairs restaurant was surprisingly nice.
  It even has a gift shop at the reception.
  The shrimp ceviche was decent.
  The strawberry milkshake was a decent size but it wasn't as good as other places as it was more icy than milky,
  even though it was _"en leche"_.
  Wifi 126/93 Mbit/s
