### Poland

One of my favourite countries.

I was very surprised how nice Poland was upon arriving, not just in one or two places either, but across the country's
major towns and cities.

- Low immigration
- Feels safer than the UK (supported by crime stats)
- Food is good and moderately priced
- Airbnbs are expensive though
- Poland is not a cheap country any more
- Large country that takes 6-8 hours to drive across
- Parking is often cheap or free after 8pm, which is great for going out to get dinner in the centres.
- Good cheap Metro

#### Augustów

Small border town on the way to Lithuania.

- [Gorący Trójkąt Pizza Augustów](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FxRFLM2NKNrGxLtf7) - highly rated pizza restaurant
- [Delissa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Tssmgh6aDC2X5yJN8) - pastry shop
- [Zygmunt August Market Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LJ91uRL6UfbrYPUBA) - the centre of town

#### Bydgoszcz

Historic town with lovely centre and plenty of good restaurants.

An excellent stopover choice when driving across Poland.

[Apteka Restauracja & Koktajlbar](https://restauracjaapteka.pl/menu/) is a recommended stop here for dinner and drinks.

#### Częstochowa

Not much there, dead if you're trying to use it for a late night stopover.

#### Gdansk

A large port city in the north of Poland.

Good restaurants and old town.

Not cheap. My Airbnb cost me more than in Dubai.

One of my colleagues is a contractor in Gdansk so gave me the local tour.

Taxis may rip you off if they hear you speak English.
He said you can get away without paying them if they don't put the meter on.
I don't know if this is true as I was driving so didn't try it.

He compared Uber like taxis apps when we went out.

Gdansk has ferry connections to Sweden.
There was zero border control coming off the ferry from Sweden to Gdansk, which surprised me.

- [Slaska 19](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274725-d13810673-Reviews-Slaska_19-Gdansk_Pomerania_Province_Northern_Poland.html) - good restaurant away from the centre with an affordable weekday lunch menu and good wifi

#### Katowice

Surprisingly busy city with large central communal areas and nightlife.

- [Tatiana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SPMj5Dqi9yBez8xv6) - decent restaurant
- [Alahamora - magiczna kawiarnia](https://alahamora.pl/) - a cafe treat for Harry Potter fans.
  Unfortunately they have no wifi.

#### Krakow

Tourist hotspot.

*"F\*ck Warsaw, go to Krakow!"*, one of my Polish colleagues told me. He was right.

There are lots of coffee shops but few restaurants that stood out to me,
as usual tourist restaurants will be more expensive and of less impressive quality.

- [Czarna Kaczka / Black Duck](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ycgm9oBHHpDfAhem9) - decent restaurant
- [Busz](https://maps.app.goo.gl/izdAfUVvP7cK4Ccm8) - busy coffee shop
- [B.O.H.O Coffee&Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yewJswg71qJYsbZT6)
- [Pierwszy Lokal na Stolarskiej po lewej stronie, idąc od Małego Rynku](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NouzQS43hFPR6uLV7) -
  busy coffee shop

#### Łódź

Medium sized city, mall and restaurants, but lacks the historical centre attraction of other Polish cities.

- [Manufaktura](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V1t63UoBryMrEUfK6) - mall, outside there are restaurants in a large pedestrian
  area

#### Nowy Sącz

Nice small centre, good for a coffee stopover on road trip between Poland and Slovakia.

- [Sofi Len Cafe](https://www.instagram.com/sofilen_kawiarnia)

#### Poznan

Historic town with lovely centre and plenty of good restaurants.

My first stopover in Poland when driving from Germany. I was pleasantly surprised how nice it was.

An excellent stopover choice when driving across Poland.

#### Sopot

The most expensive area in Poland, near Gdansk.

Good beaches, restaurants, and walkways.

#### Warsaw

Decent low pressure capital, but expensive already in terms of Airbnbs,
and in the centre people will be trying to
[entice you into strip clubs](https://medium.com/@harisekhon/salemanship-101-strip-clubs-1e2f4ed90296).

One of my colleagues moved back to Warsaw as a contractor.

Warsaw airport is deserted after 11pm as there were no night flights, it is better than many other airports but it is
not London Heathrow. This is also a big problem if you miss you transfer flight, as I did on the way to Tbilisi!

##### Metro in Warsaw

The metro is both good and cheap and recommended by locals.

##### Parking in Warsaw

Parking is free in the centre from 8pm, which is convenient for dinner.

##### Restaurants in Warsaw

<!--

- [The Club №1 Strip and Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YsN3ywgauWmqdJBn8) - expensive entry €20 but the best strip club
  in Warsaw

-->

- [ČESKÁ beer restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/h8kMmcnCpri5R1bv6) - czech restaurant, chain of two, the other being
  my favourite in Wroclaw. Get the classic traditional cesnecka garlic soup, and goulash.
  Good sized 350ml fresh orange juice for 19 pln (€4.50).
  Wifi 55/25 Mbit/s
- [Restauracja Słoik](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q1nHHoGrPK4Tertx6) - good menu of pierogi dumplings, burgers, steak and
  other mains, as well as fresh juices, and desserts.
- The duck pierogi were 7 large boiled dumplings, but the duck filling was quite fluffy instead of meaty.
  Next time I'd try a different pierogi or just a straight burger or steak.
  The warm apple pie with vanilla ice cream was much better.
  The pie came large and warm (it took a while),
  although the ice cream scoop was a bit small, but overall a very good dessert.
  The pressed apple-beetroot juice hit the spot.
  Wifi but couldn't get a speed reading, it also doesn't allow ping out, but worked well enough on Google Maps
- [Hato Sushi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/64ebeUXGC8A9iJ9MA) - catch the lunch menu if you can
- [Warszawa Wschodnia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F1f7ATy6Re3eYE4V9) - french and polish, pricey but good quality
- [Złote Tarasy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MKRDUTHwfyUFXaPT9) - central shopping mall

TODO:

- [Soul Kitchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Hv9o99jWHwBPRHhVA) - highly rated upmarket restaurant, but couldn't get in
  here without a reservation
- [Bułkę przez Bibułkę](https://maps.app.goo.gl/StZzWDg2bZofJ2fG7) - breakfast restaurant

#### Wroclaw

Pronounced Vrot-swaaf... not row-claw!

##### Parking in Wroclaw

Parking in Wroclaw is a problem, the train station costs €12 per day, while the roads are metered parking, and my car
got towed away for a temporary sign and I got blackmailed by the police and towing company for €120 to get it back!
(€20 fine, €80 towing charge, 2 x €10 per day storage charge ffs)

##### Restaurants in Wroclaw

- [Pierogarnia Rynek 26](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9GRJGoTSKP2qz7eG7) - the best pierogi I ever had (polish dumplings).
  They've taken something usually commodity and turned it into a delicacy.
  The 6 x meat variety were good (I had them boiled,
  you can have them baked too) were good and came with a perfect slightly sweet cream dip.
  The 4 x sweet desert (boiled) with fruits and creams were even better, amazing, and came with a sweet dipping cream.
  Excellent, I'd come back just for these.
  The chef's special starter of peach wrapped in bacon was also very good, contrasting the sweet peach with the savory
  and salty bacon, with cream drops on top, and sitting on a bed of arugula with balsamic drizzle - hit ones taste buds
  from all sides!
- [Folgujemy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8h5fb6W99gtENVcU7) - small gentrified bistro, the scrambled eggs were good (30pln)
  , add the bacon (+6pln) and avocado (+8pln) = 44pln (£8.60). Breakfast is only
  available until 11:45 weekdays, but all day at weekends. No wifi!!
- [Restauracja Česká](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DhETuFck1MZ9MmQ48) - czech restaurant, chain of two, the other being my
  favourite in Warsaw. This one has a great outdoor terrace on a main strip if you can get a table on it.
  Get the classic traditional cesnecka garlic soup, and goulash
- [Gniazdo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ARvLXgYN6VLLLYxx7) - eggs benedict with bacon or avocado 38pln (£7.50).
  The bacon was streaky with fat throughout but was not well done as it should be if eating bacon fat.
  Go with the avocado instead of bacon if you want a healthy option.
  The hollandaise sauce was mild with some mustard grains but not a mustardy flavour
  and the eggs were slightly overcooked so not runny.
  12/25 Mbit/s wifi
- [Wrocławski Rynek](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UY1nAXGukyFXJ1em6) - the historical town square with many restaurants
- [Galicja](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BfjQfgReuiXgZYgR6) - elegant restaurant, but was absolutely dead on a Saturday
  night, apparently due to some festival. It also closes early at 9pm.
  The chicken soup with beef dumplings and vegetable strips was surprisingly good,
  a flavourful broth poured in front of me on the small beef dumplings, which were solid first beef, none of that
  spongey rubbish one often finds in dumplings.
  The duck with red cabbage with cranberries was very good too, coming with small potato cylinders on a big plate with
  drizzle sauce, it is fine dining over quantity.
  The lunch special of soup + main + dessert for 30 pln (£6) works out much cheaper than the evening menu,
  perhaps why it was deserted, as the above two cost me 82 pln (£16), plus tip, without any drinks or dessert.
  Waitress said they had bad wifi, and didn't know the wifi password.
  Overall you might want to go with one of the lively places in the Wrocławski Rynek historical market square
