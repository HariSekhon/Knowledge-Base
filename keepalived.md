<!-- INDEX_END -->

## Key Points

- VRRP - Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol
- can manage VIP as well as IPVS and real servers configuration
- designed for LVS / IPVS (Linux Virtual Server project)
- used in OpenStack

## Test Keepalived in the foreground

```shell
keepalived -f /etc/keepalive/keepalived.conf -D -N -l
```

| Switch | Description   |
|--------|---------------|
| -n     | foreground    |
| -D     | detail        |
| -l     | log to stdout |
| -C     | check syntax  |

## Linux: allow binding to IP of VIP from Keepalived

Add to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

```properties
net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind = 1
```

Reload sysctl settings:

```shell
sysctl -p
```

## Example Config

In `/etc/keepalive/keepalived.conf`:

```text
global_defs {
  #router_id myHostname           # defaults
  #default_interface eth0
  #vrrp_version 2                 # could set 3
