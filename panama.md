## Summary

A 2nd world country at best but with 1st world US prices,
similarly priced to Costa Rica which people widely complain about being unreasonably priced for the country it is.

Everything is priced in US dollars and they accept USD or Panamanian currency which is pegged at the same exchange rate
at the US dollar.

No plans to return.

## Immigration Control - Exit Flight Required

Like several other Latin American countries,
the airline insisted on showing an actual emigration flight before they let you check-in to the flight there.

You also need to fill in an online travel declaration here at the official website before you travel

<https://declaraciondeviajero.ana.gob.pa/Declaracion/>

Do not use any of the other websites, as they are 3rd party and will ask you to pay a needless \$27.

They recommend 3 days before but I did it the night before -
you just need to get the QR code emailed to you to show to the immigration officer.

## Spanish Crash Course

See the [Spanish Crash Course](spanish.md) page.

## Panama City

The capital is a strange mix of high rise towers in an otherwise 3rd world country,
and you only need to go one block from some tourist area to see a ghetto
(eg. one block West of [Plaza Herrera](https://maps.app.goo.gl/426DkZdiG1bTh1pE6)).

The best areas to stay are either in the old town
[San Felipe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/S2STrwEaPa9LVGJh6) (touristy, expensive)
or at the other end of the long coast walk around
[Marbella](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n6eUv9S3nfteq17J7) or
[Punta Paitilla](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tXcdWAkAgv5Bd9ng8) which are slightly less touristy and cheaper.

### Panama City Airport - Tocumen International

Lots of shops in the departure terminals after security.

There are water coolers outside the toilets so use a refillable water cannister
and avoid getting price gouged for plastic bottled water.

### Transport in Panama City

#### Buses

You need a prepay MetroBus card to travel around, buses do not accept cash.

You can buy this MetroBus card at a station for \$2 with a minimum \$0.50 credit,
I suggest loading at least \$2 - \$5 on it as it costs \$0.25 - \$0.75 per ride and an additional \$0.75 just to enter a
metrobus station like the central coastal hub [Zona Paga 5 de Mayo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VykmrXH1BVQRStFq8).

There are turnstyle barriers on the buses themselves which seems extreme,
I guess to stop the 3rd worlders from barging their way in and causing problems for the bus drivers?

You must touch your card on the entry point to be able to get through the entry turnstyle on the buses, and
if you don't have enough credit left,
bad luck because it's not at the discretion of the bus driver to let you ride like in some other countries.
You'll have to walk around to find somewhere that can sell you a top up, which is usually a cash-only purchase too.

Also, beware Google Maps was wrong and caused me to get a on S530 bus at the Zona Paga 5 de Maya metrobus station above
which wasn't going north east to Centro Balboa,
I had to go again to jump off immediately outside the station after realizing the bus driver indicated right at the
traffic lights instead of left, and confirming with him that he did not go to Centro Balboa.

I then got a correct 420 or 480 bus, burning the previously used credit on the bus and metro station gates.

To make matters worse,
I once took a correct 420 bus but as I got on I asked the bus driver if he went to Centro Balboa and he said no, but I
ignored him and got on anyway taking the chance as the bus was going in the right direction and I'd just watch Google Maps if it veered off the expected course.
Of course it did go there and the bus driver was wrong
or there was a miscommunication since they almost never speak English.

You are well advised to learn some Spanish as none of the bus drivers I spoke to spoke English,
see the [Spanish Crash Course](#spanish-crash-course) section above.

#### Taxis in Panama City

Taxis are reasonably priced in Panama City, but of course around 8 times what the bus costs.

If you're single, have time and want to do it the local way, try the buses, they're quite quick up and down the coast
once you figure out what you're doing.

If there are two of you, you might as well take an InDrive taxi...

- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/) - cheaper than Uber, but often cash only (US dollars or Panama currency which is the
  same numerically as they peg to the dollar)
- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/global/en/r/cities/panama-panama-pa/) - if you have zero dollars and need to use card

### Restaurants in Panama City

This is the only country where I didn't eat out as the restaurants were already closed by 7pm when I arrived on
Christmas Eve so I had to buy groceries and cook instead.

The only restaurant open in my area was a jewish restaurant charging $100 per person, a complete rip off.

<!--

[Hostal Casa Areka Panama](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F2Eu6GZo8Ug4VSBQ9) - lockers are rickety, not really safe, you've
got to be careful to align them properly so they can't be opened once padlocked. No privacy curtains,
and kitchen curfew 9:30pm with gas switched off.
247/430 MBit/s wifi
