## AWS vs GCP

A common staying:

> Google’s Beta is like AWS’s GA

- Google is strongly consistent eg. GCS consistent lists and gets, KMS global consistent, Cloud Spanner
  - AWS has a lot of eventually consistent services, which pushes complexity to the developer
- GCE can configure any CPU / RAM ratio and has few simpler instance types: micro, standard, highmem, highcpu
- GCP resource names are shorter or named yourself, not `<tonnesOfChars>.cloudfront.net`
- GCP console global view
  - AWS region view
- GCP doesn’t requires 2FA every day like AWS
- GCS S3 API doesn't require S3 Proxy like Azure
- GCP live migrates VMs
  - AWS maintenance requires a reboot
- GCE Preemptible instances 80% discount for 30 sec warning
  - AWS Spot Instances with 2 min warning - GCE can spin up instances quicker though as a result
- GCE Committed Use Discounts buy CPU / RAM / disk 1 to 3 years can be used on any instance in region,
  unlike AWS Reserved Instances which are tied to family
  - automatically applied to anything you run, and above that Sustained Use Discounts are applied automatically
- GCP networks are global with no cost for inter-region traffic
  - AWS requires NAT Gateway (or deprecated Nat Instance) for inter-region VPC traffic

<!-- -->

- AWS Billing better reports + estimated usage
  - GCP only alerts on actual usage, must set 25%, 50% alerts etc.
    - new Billing Forecasts feature may solve this forecast alerting

<!-- -->

- GCP developer focused moving towards ops
  - builds innovative tools that you couldn't build/deploy yourself
  - global focus - easier to handle latency & failures
- AWS ops focused moving towards development
  - strip-mines open source tools and automates their management
  - regional focus - simplifies data sovereignty

<!-- -->

- AWS Secrets Manager
  - GCP has Cloud KMS and HSM, or can use EnvKey

<!-- -->

- GCE default I/O is faster than AWS which requires using Provisioned IOPS EBS volume which cost almost double
- GCE block storage 10TB max vs AWS 1TB max (check these as these sorts of limits change over time)
- GCE block storage can be mounted read-only to many other instances
- AWS more instance types
- AWS more regions + availability zones
- GCE live migration of instances for zero downtime when doing host hardware maintenance,
  but may need to downtime an entire site??
- GCE auto restart option, auto-respawns in < 3 mins
- AWS more services
- AWS more OS images
- AWS has spot instances
- AWS has reserved instances
- AWS developer / business support is cheaper than GCP (49 or 100 dollars for AWS vs 150 or 400 dollars for GCP)
- AWS LDAP or custom users without email, Google require GMail account
- AWS uses Xen, GCE uses KVM
- GCE snapshots are global not region + copy
- GCE better inter-region speeds (300 vs 40MB/s)
- Google has better global dark fiber network

### Cloud Billing Costs

When you're a senior engineer from before the era of Cloud and see your Cloud Billing costs:
