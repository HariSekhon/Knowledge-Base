### Morocco

The menus are in French!

There are stray cats everywhere.

I got food poisoning in Morocco.

If you have a curious nose, Morocco is a land of intrigue with a bounty of interesting produce in bazaars.
Not all smells are pleasant though.
If you have a sensitive nose you may have had your nasal fill pretty quickly
(or if you're struggling with food poisoning with many smells making your frequently stomach churn for days).
Do not book a long time in Morocco on your first visit in case you don't like the constant smells.

In the bazaars, do not let local people _"help"_ you by leading to you places,
they are clearing getting kickbacks by the owners to lead you to 3.7 star places that you would not choose.
When you decide to not stay, and they don't get their kickbacks, they then start hassling your for direct *tips*.

Use Google Maps instead (see the [e-sim data section](#digital-e-sims) above) and rely on reviews of places with high
numbers of reviews to reduce the likelihood of swaying / gaming the system via fake reviews.

Below are some I have visited personally and the better ones I'd recommend.

There are also old women almost shouting at you as you pass by in native language (presumably aggressive begging).
This is probably what western feminists would be doing if they weren't
[stealing so much of your income](https://avoiceformen.com/featured/research-finds-that-as-a-group-only-men-pay-tax/)
via the high tax and inflationary money printing feminist-socialist welfare state.
I prefer the Moroccan system here as this situation implies more consent for men (you can safely ignore them),
but actually the Moroccan tax rates are still far too high (of course they are, they have universal suffrage).

#### Taxis in Morocco

- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/en-ma) - cheaper and good taxi app, you can pre-agree the fee up front
  (still have to pay cash not in app)
- [Careem](https://www.careem.com/) - the same super popular Careem app that I still had installed from [Dubai](#dubai)
  worked here without having to change anything
- Airport Taxis are the worst - do not use them - they overcharged me 3x
  - they quote every idiot coming out of the airport 150 MAD which I only realized was a rip off when I asked a local
    and was recommended to use the InDrive app to go back to the airport - it quoted me only 54 MAD for an instant
    guarantee of any driver in the area without me bidding a price which could be lower
  - The Airport Taxis are thieves, and they also even insist on cash

#### Tangiers

Beach city in northern Morocco.

- [Le Mekong](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Kot4Ec67qZNFuxTy8) - great sushi and vietnamese food.
  The spicy shrimp with rice was great and the Isla Blanca fried sushi with pineapple was excellent.
  They also do wooden boats filled with a selection of sushi.
  Has Wifi.

- [Boutique Burger](https://maps.app.goo.gl/k1D2MvJyEvzLWZcf6) - possibly the best fries I've ever had anywhere, crispy deep fried on the outside and light
  and fluffy on the inside. The popular Texas pulled beef burger was great, the greek salad was a good size with very
  good ingredients but an average dressing. Of course there is fresh orange juice at a reasonable price, as there is in
  many places in Morocco. Bring your travel adapter because there's Wifi and plugs by the tables.

- [Restaurant Cafe La Playa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Lrep4uahqy88cERR6) - cash only but great Moroccan food, prices and service, with a very comfortable
  upstairs lounge area and wifi. I recommend the Tajine with beef and prunes, the Moroccan salad (side) and the lentils
  starters. The bread is home made and very good too, fresh squeezed juices are both well priced and good sizes.
  Wifi and plugs available upstairs, and if you site on one end youhave an open window view of the sea.
  Worth the discovery.
  Cash only.

- [Abou Tayssir](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MNNY17v67nSgrCZ16) - the Fattoush salad was amazing, the meat + rice dish of the day was ok but I'd probably go with
  individual plates next time. Fresh squeezed juice was good. Prices were similar to other places. No wifi, cash only

- [Alma Kitchen & Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9bD1hQnonnX2w3TZ8) - good but a bit expensive by local standards
