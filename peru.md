## Summary

A lot of people have raved to me about Peru and a lot of westerners go there for the famous Machu Pichu.

The currency is the Peruvian Sol which is roughly 3.3 per \$1 or 4.5 per £1 as of Jan 2026.

## Lima

The capital, 2 days recommended.

### Lima Airport Transport

You can take the official Airport Express bus from opposite the Arrivals door 3 -
the booth is across the road and they take card payments.

It's only 20 Peruvian Sol (\$6) as of Jan 2026, but it only leaves once an hour.

There is air conditioning and wifi on board - 44/31 Mbit/s.. although I didn't see any plugs or USB charging ports.

Due to the long wait I did try to get a QuickLlama bus which goes more frequently but apparently you need to reserve
them in advance and I couldn't find their stall.

### Best Areas to Stay in Lima

<!-- [Pariwana hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sHzLrj5mUrU8qQWB8) was great, lots of social activities,
and kitchen but you have to ask the bar for a pan, they don't keep them in there -->

- [Miraflores](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QBzFkX21w2ACk4NTA) - tourist area, close to the ocean and parks
  - [Parque Kennedy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dznhsVv1AfuFK1uM8) - central, lively area with lots of cafes & restaurants
  - [Malecón de Miraflores](https://maps.app.goo.gl/19bYcAJ347rzuUU79) - cliff side ocean views, quieter
- [Barranco](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JhNDhgGmrBHFDECMA) - considered trendier & more artsy, has bars & nightlife
