Buyt this before using the motorways driving around Slovakia.

Use the official site rather than resellers, it's cheaper:

## Bratislava

Bratislava is nowhere near as big as Budapest, you probably don't need more than 3 nights here.

- [Urban House](Urban House) - very popular highly rated bar restaurant. The truffle roasted chicken was good - it comes
  with truffle potatoes au gratin, glazed carrots, green aparagus, truffle sauce, portobello mushrooms and fresh
  truffle. The Buffalo & Hot Honey pizza was even better, with prosciutto ham,
  buffalo chilli honey, burrata, pumpkin seeds, mozarella, jalapeno, pomodoro, capers and parmesan.
  The desserts were really good too - the pinacolada cake was excellent, with pineapple,
  coconut, yuzu, mango, Malibu, white chocolate, vanilla.
  The jasmine mango cheesecake was great too, with white chocolate, mango and passionfruit
- [Le Papillon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qnf4XpgV5PNMQqoR6) - excellent good menu and moderate prices, especially
  considering the prime location on one of the main strip. Popular, good ambience, music, decor, indoor and outdoor
  seating. Food is modern Slovak fusion, rather than traditional,
  means many dishes with flair, home made sauces, sauteed meats, great healthy options like fancy salads, drinks etc.
  The chicken steak with sweet potatoes, bacon-onion chutney and herb chilli pesto and fig was great.
  TODO: try the beef bowl with egg, and chicken bowl with salad, mango and pomegranate.
  Excellent light meals perhaps in between other meals. 911/47 Mbit/s wifi
- [Buny Bakery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cyQYGzUTbhYdreQd8) - truffle eggs benedict with ham was surprisingly good,
  although could have been bigger, and it should be good for €13!
  The bacon benedict for €12 is also really good, although similar to the truffle eggs benedict, could be bigger.
  The kitchen closes at 15:50 unfortunately, had on my second visit I had to have the foccaccia serano ham from the
  counter display, which while fancy looking, lacks much nutritional substance as it's mainly bread, and probably isn't
  worth €8. 356/42 Mbit/s wifi
- [Koliba Kamzík Zelená](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PrcVvnPB4wbVgqaSA) - upmarket restaurant on a side street so less of a
  tourist trap.
  The garlic soup with smoked cheese and herb croutons is a traditional cesnecka soup,
  which is common in Czechia too.
  My friend had the pork belly and didn't rate it though.
  I don't recommend getting pork belly anywhere as it is fatty.
  It came quickly and was pretty good, although I've had better, such as in my czech restaurant pick in Warsaw.
  Beef sirloin with bacon on creamy vegetable sauce comes with 2 large homemade streamed dumplings filled with
  cranberries. Wifi network "Aplend" is open with 94/10 Mbit/s speed
- [Otto](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C7CUXnotEU7mm6aK7) - serves breakfast until 3pm. The eggs benedict comes with homemade
  ham and a mildly mustard hollandaise sauce, which was all very good. 6/8 Mbit/s wifi
- [Mondieu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dwtCzwTZmc2TAdS28) - upmarket cafe restaurant chain with outdoor seating overlooking
  the river, good menu of breakfasts, mains, smoothies, and even acai bowl.
  Kitchen closes 1 hour before and breakfast is only served until 11:30 weekdays and 12:30 weekends unfortunately.
  9/2 Mbit/s wifi outside. Most venues in Bratislava, as well as Prague and Dubai
- [Bratislava Flagship Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RwJ5kwom3JpC2pFY9) - very busy commercial tourist restaurant
  with nice historic decor in the main upper floor of restaurant.
  Prices are a bit high eg. €19 for the duck leg with cabbage, and a very small side salad of tomatoes, cucumber and
  peppers was €4.
  The cesnakovy (garlic soup)is decent, with lots of cheese at the bottom,
  although not much soup volume, only 330ml, and comes in a mug with 2 sided handle, and only 2 small slices of bread.
  There is a version served in a whole bread bowl.
  Tables are mostly not reservable and given to walk-ins.
  The restaurant's wifi network isn't found in the top level,
  VisitBratislava was found instead but wouldn't connect due to weak signal.
  The top level has large long benches
  where tour guides lead in old insuffferable American tourist groups from places like California
  (you know the type, boomers that have parasited the wealth out of the new generations via asset inflation).
  The restaurant closes at 10pm but the kitchen closes at 9:30pm
- [Eggstro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xZcXH3jG4xFcXPTm8) - has no poached eggs, apparently everybody is asking for them.
  I had the scrambled eggs on toast with avocado and smoked salmon, but I thought the portion size wasn't large.
  Stunningly fast 710/52 Mbit/s wifi
- [Tsuki - Asian food & Sushi & Poke & Cafe Viet Nam](https://maps.app.goo.gl/12Cq6FHdQdNudSAVA) - 2 restaurants in one,
  the Salmon Poke bowl was really good. They weren't on the menu I saw which was full of sushi, but I asked the waiter
  for it after seeing it on Google Maps. 47/8 Mbit/s wifi

## Kosice

Small city with a nice historic centre, but none of the venues I tried impressed me.

Would try [Slavia](https://www.kaviarenslavia.sk/jedalny-listok/) if I were to visit gain.
