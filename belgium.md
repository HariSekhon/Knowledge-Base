<!-- INDEX_END -->

Nice small country, easy to drive from the UK, perhaps 2-3 hours after a ferry from Dover to Calais.

## Antwerp

Port city, not much there from what I recall, been to a good restaurant there but can't remember its name.

## Brussels

A bit of a western capital dump with high immigration, graffiti etc.

## Bruges / Brugge

West Belgium is nicer, with Bruges having a historic town catering to tourists with restaurants, ice creams and
coffee shops.

[Marco Polo Noodles](https://www.marco-polo-noodles.com/) is recommended on the main strip.

## Ghent / Gent

City with a mix of old and new, not quite as nice as Bruges, but better than Brussels.

[Seli's Noodle Bar](https://www.selinoodlebar.be/) and [Soup Lounge](https://www.souplounge.be/) are both recommended
here, and both are very affordable.

## Liege

Liege is worse than Brussels, with high incidence of homelessness and street begging.

## Waterloo

Gentrified town just south of Brussels where Napoleon lost the famous battle.

[Le Bar À Soupe](https://www.facebook.com/people/Le-Bar-%C3%A0-Soupe/100063541241931/),
Savage Burger and [Thai Cafe](https://thai.cafe/en) are recommended here, with the latter being more expensive.
You will need your Google Translate camera app to translate the menu as they don't speak English.
