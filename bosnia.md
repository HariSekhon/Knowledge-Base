Reasonably priced holiday destination.

Olimpija is a good local spring water from Bosnia.

## Sarajevo

Sarajevo is a small capital where the hot spots are so condensed that we bumped into several people we met twice on
different days.

### Taxis in Sarajevo

- [MojTaxi](https://www.mojtaxi.ba/) - didn't find any cars for me at the Bus Station East Sarajevo. I ended up taking
  a local metered taxi which cost a ridiculous 50 bam (€25), more than the coach ride from Belgrade all the way away in
  Serbia. Next time if not pressed for time I would just follow Google Maps and take public transport for 1.80 bam (~€1)

### Restaurants in Sarajevo

- [Backyard Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aghEgwGJRq5A89qU7) - probably the best coffee shop in Sarajevo - I
  was lucky this was recommended to me by a local - great ambience, decor, good menu of teas, coffees, frappuccinos,
  fresh squeezed juices, bagels, sandwiches, croissants, donuts, muffins, puddings and
  other snacks.
  They’ve even got cookies and cocktails.
  Busy even at 9:30pm on a Tuesday night.
  They've even got a coworking room with tables downstairs.
  Wifi 169/29 Mbit/s
- [Baščaršija](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cg7VwRcCLD6UVhEu9) - historic market full of dessert shops and cafes
  - [Sebilj](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Vn4QjFp9PgVMehtV7) - historic fountain, several best highest rated coffee shops are
    just 1 minute north of this:
    - [Ministry of Ćejf](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QKVSmjuYKDnT1spo7) - coffees, teas, and fresh orange juice. The applie
      pie is more of an apple pastry rather than the pie that westerners would expect
    - [Teahouse Džirlo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PHEk2d2t5S7EsVZz7)
    - [Caffe Asik](https://maps.app.goo.gl/P2wanuTnmCybvzqo6)
    - [Behut Coffee shop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/518haTQ4e1auHr4o6)
    - [Hanuma 2d Coffe & More](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SghZG5ZB5dVStNnh7)
- [Yellow Fortress](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aqEnRcYYuw1AiQEFA) - good view point - has a cafe up there
  - [Kamarija](https://maps.app.goo.gl/974a8E3fj5UAFACe6) - an even better cafe outside with a lovely seating area and
    view, fresh juices, lemonades, hot chocolates and coffees
- [SCC - Sarajevo City Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/beyUhkL45r4kF6Yb6) - main mall with lots of designer shops and
  cafes, 3rd floor has an entire row of shoe shops
- [Alta Shopping Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1QxE1Lt4534ac1qQ8) - smaller mall opposite SCC
  - [Borbono caffè, wine & snack bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n3FD7qd1zaY74YCY8) - cafe with nice view across to the SCC
- [Klopa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3DRwS29Bk7LrZihh6) - the speciality platter with veal chops and beefsteak was great,
 and came with lots of salad, potatoes, 3 dips and warm bread - a really full meal for two.
 They even have various fresh and mixed juice.
 This was surprisingly good for a place so central, I had expected it to be a tourist trap
- [Besame Mucho](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kU4tizwGMAkukKTS7) - the Bosnian speciality dumplings were even better than
  expected, and the veal stew was very good too.
  I could have eaten more of them.
  The baked apple filled with wallnuts and topped with cream was a nice dessert too
- [Brunch Sa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8CaAL75233e74Qa66) - they have freshly squeezed orange juice (6 bam / €3) and the
  “Bosnian breakfast” special with 2 eggs was decent and reasonably priced at 12.50 bam (€6.50), cheaper than the more
  touristy dishes like eggs benedict or eggs royale on their menu.
  Closes early at 4pm so get there early in the day
- [Spazio Gourmet](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VkeAMmvNs2VNtCnL8) - fine italian dining with good decor at a moderate price.
  Good menu and desserts, near the two malls, good spot for after a shopping day, with both indoor and outdoor seating.
  The chicken with green pepper and white sauce risotto with Arborio rice was good,
  and comes topped with those small blue edible flowers, a nice touch.
  The chicken curry was also good, the yellow rice was served in a separate dish.
  The desserts look good but haven't tried them yet.
  There is also an ice cream stand outside.
  Service was slow though, we very nearly left for another place trying to call the waiter over for several minutes
- [Ćevabdžinica Petica Ferhatović](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bzzbnLpN46CP597C8) - the veal skewers are good here, and
  affordable at €4-8 for 1-2 skewers, with 5 cubes of meat per skewer, and it comes with a fresh warm large pita bread.
  Add the domaca mixed salad for 5 bam (€2.50) to compliment it.
  They have wifi
- [Buregdžinica Bosna](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BaZP8ngARzq2179w8) - recommended by a local, even better cevapi than
  Ćevabdžinica Željo below (less salty).
  For an optimum order, get the 5 cevapi in bread (ask for kajmak in it),
  then add the smaller sized portions of several other meats like chicken breast / thighs, liver, sausages etc to try a
  bit of everything
- [Ćevabdžinica Željo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6jzxJUFw6VnxfJRDA) - affordable good quality cevapi for €5-7 in a fresh
  warm large home made pita bread - get the kajmak add-on
- [Smashburger Marindvor](https://maps.app.goo.gl/U6LUtdwoJakKJRri6) - very good affordable burger restaurant, the
  classic with pickles was my choice here for only €6.
  This is more of a takeaway place as it only has a couple tables inside, and a couple tables outside, and there is a
  sink to wash hands but surprisingly no toilet
- [Fehmi 1958](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TDTHpBN8fp8qBHqs7) - dessert shop - the speciality is the 3 types of halva
  on top of an thin ice cream base.
  When I took my friend there later in the day they had run out of things by 10pm, an hour before closing time
- [Caribou Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kiCaFwsNLMZ14EhV7) - bosnian coffee chain, this one is by the two malls.
  Their speciality salted caramel budino is the popular drink here, and for good reason, it is tasty!
  Wifi 172/19 Mbit/s, upstairs seating with both smoking and non-smoking sections and laptop people with plugs
- [City Lounge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9P7g6HHgwrxRAkcS8) - popular bar lounge - there isn't much else open late night
  in Sarajevo on a non Friday/Satuday night so people congregate here
- [Tesla](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cisSC96xRtPW9iG29) - late night pub, opposite City Lounge
- [Market Srce](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WLkbeovu4SxNfz969) - 24/7 convenience store, next to Tesla pub and opposite
  City Lounge - popular because this is a late night spot and also everything else is closed

**Not Recommended**:

- [ASDŽ Aščinica](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1TEMXeFvTp7doKNK6) - touristy place banking on _"Bosnian"_ food but small
  portions for the money and and very little meat in the veal okra stew. Also, cash only
- [Nanina Kuhinja](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7p13d2c2oF3f18nEA) - nice outdoor seating but the food is mediocre,
  and worse, similarly priced to Spazio Gourmet from the recommended list.
  The veal stew with carrot and onions came in a watery base instead of the rich red base in the picture, and the mixed
  Bosnian mixed meat in green pepper and onions was fairly mediciore too.
  There are better places to eat for this money.

TODO:

- [Caffe Ayna](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AqooSEvGc5uBY7Fj6)
- [Dveri](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aTEmPWvazcY5trL68) - kitchen was closed by 9:50pm even though it's supposed to be open
  until 11pm

- [Ćevabdžinica Petica Ferhatović](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kVro98MEgaJyzRJm6) - recommended by a local

  a later breakfast here than most places
- [Kiren Sarajevo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xR2a8vR9fHxUsx1r7) - fine dining near the base of the walk up to the
  Yellow Fortress

## Mostar

Tourist tax is €5 per night in Mostar, which is surprisingly high relative to other places around Europe.

For those of you on a budget using Hostelworld or similar, be aware this is a hidden accommodation cost not included
on the site which will increase your accommodation costs by roughly 30%.

The Old Bridge is the centre of the town, but this is very smooth slippery stone and has raised stone beams across it
to allow people to walk on it where their shoes would otherwise not hold.
The old town streets are cobbled stones, so this is not a good town to visit if you have young children that need
buggies.

### Train to Mostar

You can get the train to Mostar from Sarajevo for 14km (€7) - it takes 2 hours from
[Sarajevo railway station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jUBN2V3BTtJWx2kj6) to
[Mostar railway station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GTuL2bWVwY5GjvC36).

### Restaurants in Mostar

Restaurants in the south near the touristy [Old Bridge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DovhiYyVk3nLwAJz7) are twice the price
of restaurants in the north end of the town, a mere few minutes walk away.

- [Caffe bar Kafić Mostar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DDi3ejVJDUAHufhK9) &
  [Fabrika Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dUSXxQyMo5YDDk4e6) - excellent stylish outdoor courtyard co-joined coffee
  shops, open late until 11:30pm, great for socializing in the summer.
  Kafic is better in that it has fresh orange juice 0.3l for 5 bam (€2.50), which Fabrika does not.
  Fabrika has homemade lemonade based on syrup, nowhere near as healthy, but their chocolate croissant was good.
  Karic wifi 23/7 Mbit/s, Fabrika has wifi too, so there are two overlapping networks for the same courtyard
- [Caffe bar i pizzeria meet&eat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iZWQUhMBYRRTfNYw7) - surprisingly good, was recommended by a
  local.
  This places is worth hitting just for the desserts as I found out afterwards.
  The chicken salad the local recommended exceeded expectations,
  this is not the pathetic chicken salads you get in most other places...
  it came stacked on a large oval plate with plenty of chicken on a large heaped salad mound and drenched in a dressing
  that was tastier than it looked.
  Within 3 seconds of it being delivered I had a street cat by my feet mooching chicken off me.
  It saw me coming 😂... the portion and quality was more than I could ask for 11 bam (€5.50).
  The fresh juice was 0.3l so not as generous as the chicken salad in portion, but for 5 bam (€2.50) this was decent
  too.
  There is also a large selection of traditional desserts, cakes, pancakes, omelettes, pizzas, pastas, and panini style
  sandwiches.
  The salad section is small by comparison to the other sections, I would have overlooked it had it not been
  specifically mentioned to me half an hour earlier by a local.
  The cupavac (lemington cake) dessert was very good, but too big for me to fit in a second dessert.
  I must come back to try the other desserts here!
  Wifi 74/19 Mbit/s outside, there are 3 networks, the password for one is on the back of the menu,
  the other two are captcha portals where you just have to click through.
  Cash only
- [Aščinica Sahan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aPdGmdb7kTBYffZ87) - recommended by a local - like most foodie places, it
  closes early at 5pm (breakfast until 12pm) so get there early. The Grah beans came soup-like with 2 pieces of beef in
  it (had to remove fat from the side of one of them) but at 7 bam (€3.50) one can’t complain! The sampita dessert was
  very good too, a light meringue cream block on top of a soft sponge base - it came twice the size I expected and I
  meant to leave half of it to save my abs, but ended up eating the whole thing! And at 2.50 bam (€1.25) you just have
  to have it! Cash only
- [Grill Centar Mostar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UxR3tJqeJ9ZH1RzA9) - good food and affordable prices - pick two smaller
  portions to try different things, or go with the veal skewers which only come in full size
  (they used to have a smaller portion option for veal skewers but alas no longer).
  The bosnian sausages were very nice, better than I expected -
  a small portion is 2 of them (long and thin), so not much food in terms of portion size, especially compared to the
  chicken.
  The _"small"_ portion of chicken thigh was a much bigger portion of food, slightly salty but very good.
  Mustard and onions came on the side along with a decent sized bread cut in half horizontally.
  Small portions are 7 bam (€3.50) which very affordable,
  but if you choose 2 small portions there is a deal not on the board for only 12 bam (€6).
  Wifi 2/2 Mbit/s
- [Cafe Marshall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sYWFqA8XrBQEuckr9) - central cafe bar, was open much later than the 11pm
  Google says, at least 1pm on Wednesday iirc. I don't know what's with the rating, there isn't much to get wrong
  getting a chilled pre-bottled schweppes for €2.50...
- [Dönerland](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9XphxTPzw7wG2VcF9) - late night kebab, only if you really have to - only has doner
  beef/chicken/mix, in toasted pita, wrap or salad bowl.
  Late night food of last resort because it’s the only thing open past 11pm.
  The fries were good though, hot and crispy... and they have wifi and accept cards
- [Konzum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wwA88t4yjXaCGdn1A) - small supermarket, buy water at a fraction of the price of the
  tourist trap places
- [Museum Of War And Genocide Victims](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DVbmF51cGkjD5jVr5) - if you're into that sort of thing...
- [Old Bridge Mostar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DovhiYyVk3nLwAJz7) - the historic bridge in the centre, you can't miss it
- [Most Bunur](https://maps.app.goo.gl/D5BbGksdx1o8So4SA) - another bridge by Fabrika Coffee

TODO:

- [Timber & Stone Tavern Mostar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZBpGjvCMLwC2D4RHA) - reasonable main prices, but small 0.2l
  juices though
- [Restaurant Šadrvan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SuRTT6JqU9Gro3vg6) - recommended by a local, but tourist trap prices
- [Restoran Kaldrma](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HSMHp1DQFam4h9186)

- [Donkebab](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3xmCYr9xehCv8uaK8) - recommended by local, not as late night kebab, closes 11:30pm
- [Terrace Lagero](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2qbGKbBW3dfayyyT7)
- [URBAN taste of orient](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e1rt1n4HkLDf7Hsk7) - view of the river and bridge so tourist trap
  prices, eg.
  chicken salad is twice the price of Caffe bar i pizzeria meet&eat
  that was recommended to me by a local and is near the top of my picks list
- [Vrata Orijenta](https://maps.app.goo.gl/T546UAKKiWYftL8B6) - well rated but prices seem a bit tourist trap due to the
  prime location

Not Recommended:

- [Ćevabdžinica KORZO](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GgBF9LR5dubC4m1o6) - the veal skewers were ok, but the sausages were soft
  indicating low meat content and nowhere near as good as the ones I had at Grill Centar Mostar the day before.
  I only ended up here because Grill Centar Mostar closed earlier than expected at 10pm instead of 11pm
- [Café de Alma](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C3Z9SumgFvTUb4PSA) - despite the good rating, and closing early at 6pm,
  it is very quiet off the beaten track, you wouldn't even know it's there if you didn't look for it explicitly as I
  passed it several times before, meaning it is quiet by 5pm even on a Friday, whereas the places just a few feet away
  are lively.
  It has no menu as there is only 3 things on offer - Bosnian coffee, herbal tea, and syrup-based lemonade,
  which is of course one of the worst things you can drink
