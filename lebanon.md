Lebanon is actually quite expensive, western prices, surprising for a country with such low GDP per capita.

However at the same time it is pretty 3rd world with regular power cuts.

Both the Bros burger restaurant and my accommodation had power cuts on my first and second nights.

## Cash & ATMs

You will need to withdraw US dollars because the local currency has suffer hyper inflation to the point where it is 1M
Lebanese Pounds to eat food!

The menus often don't even have their prices printed due to the instability of the currency,
instead referring to online menus in US dollars.

The first 2 ATMs I went to had no cash to dispense to me at all.

The next 2 ATMs charged 5% on top of the withdrawal amount - seeing a $25 charge is not cool,
so I reduced my withdrawal to minimize fees.

If you can, take US dollars cash before you get there.

## Beirut

### Taxis in Beirut

**Do NOT use the taxis waiting outside the airport - they will try to rip you off for \$30-$40 instead
of the \$7-\$20 on Bolt or Uber**

### Restaurants in Beirut

<!--

The Colony Hostel is $15 per night but it's not that nice,
there is no soap in the bathroom for example and it's not clean.

The volunteer, however, was excellent, cooking great food for \$5, bargain.

- [The Bros](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F8ikpQ9L4teVq8Z89) - good but western prices, \$19 for a burger and fries!
  The burning man burger with swiss cheese, mixed peppers and a bit of spicyness is quite good.
  The fries with the salt & vinegar power is actually really good,
  it's quite rare to get that powder vinegar and I like it.
  Wifi 8/4 Mbit/s
- [Downtown Beirut]()
- [Swirkies London]() - \$5-\$6 for medium or large soft machine ice cream (what they call "merry cream" or Brits call
  "soft whip") and \$1 per topping.
  Expensive by international standards but it is open late so if you want late night ice cream this is one of the few
  options around midnight
