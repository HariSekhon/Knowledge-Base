Lebanon is actually quite expensive, western prices, surprising for a country with such low GDP per capita.

## Cash & ATMs

You will need to withdraw US dollars because the local currency has suffer hyper inflation to the point where it is 1M
Lebanese Pounds to eat food!

The menus on some places don't even have their prices printed due to the instability of the currency.

The first 2 ATMs I went to had no cash to dispense to me.

If you can, take US dollars cash before you get there.

## Beirut

### Taxis in Beirut

**Do NOT use the taxis waiting outside the airport - they will try to rip you off for \$30-$40 instead
of the \$7-\$20 on Bolt or Uber**

### Restaurants in Beirut

- [The Bros](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F8ikpQ9L4teVq8Z89) - good but western prices, \$19 for a burger and fries!
  The burning man burger with swiss cheese, mixed peppers and a bit of spicyness is quite good.
  The fries with the salt & vinegar power is actually really good,
  it's quite rare to get that powder vinegar and I like it.
