## Beirut

### Taxis in Beirut

**Do NOT use the taxis waiting outside the airport - they will try to rip you off for \$30-$40 instead
of the \$7-\$20 on Bolt or Uber**

- [Bolt](https://bolt.eu/en/)
- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/)

### Restaurants in Beirut

- [The Bros](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F8ikpQ9L4teVq8Z89) - good but western prices, \$19 for a burger and fries!
  The burning man burger with swiss cheese, mixed peppers and a bit of spicyness is quite good.
  The fries with the salt & vinegar power is actually really good,
  it's quite rare to get that powder vinegar and I like it.
