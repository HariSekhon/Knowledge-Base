Lebanon is a 3rd world country with hyper inflation to such extent that the locals use US dollars.

It's actually quite expensive, western prices,
surprising for a country with such low GDP per capita,
explained by the inflation problem and the dependence on foreign incomes.

This is easily one of the worst countries I've seen for cost of living vs incomes,
everything is western price expensive, from taxis to restaurants to supermarkets.

Lebanon even has regular power cuts.

Both the Bros burger restaurant and my accommodation had power cuts on my first and second nights.

## Cash & ATMs

You will need to withdraw US dollars because the local currency has suffer hyper inflation to the point where it is 1M
Lebanese Pounds to eat food!

The menus often don't even have their prices printed due to the instability of the currency,
instead referring to online menus in US dollars.

The first 2 ATMs I went to had no cash to dispense to me at all.

The next 2 ATMs charged 5% on top of the withdrawal amount - seeing a $25 charge is not cool,
so I reduced my withdrawal to minimize fees.

If you can, take US dollars cash before you get there.

## Beirut

The city lacks good civil planning.

You can find some of the same international chain stores and restaurants,
but it is not such a great walk around due to the lack of civil planning compared to European cities.

Even crossing the street can be a challenge with lack of traffic crossings - there are some faded zebra crossings but
cars don't always respect them.
You may also notice poles which used to have traffic lights on them,
and some of the public phones have been stripped for parts too - overall a very 3rd world city.

It is a far cry today from _"The Paris of the Middle East"_ in the mid 20th century,
before the war,
and has been surpassed by gulf countries since then which looks like they are from a completely different century.

### Taxis in Beirut

**Do NOT use the taxis waiting outside the airport - they will try to rip you off for \$30-$40 instead
of the \$7-\$20 on Bolt or Uber**

- [Bolt](https://bolt.eu/en/)
- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/)

### Restaurants in Beirut

<!--

The Colony Hostel is $15 per night but it's not that nice,
there is no soap in the bathroom for example and it's not clean.

The volunteer, however, was excellent, cooking great food for \$5, bargain.

-->

- [The Bros](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F8ikpQ9L4teVq8Z89) - good but western prices, \$19 for a burger and fries!
  The burning man burger with swiss cheese, mixed peppers and a bit of spicyness is quite good.
  The fries with the salt & vinegar power is actually really good,
  it's quite rare to get that powder vinegar and I like it.
  Wifi 8/4 Mbit/s
- [Crave's Burger](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GNfuzyuaNdYozDh36) - decent burger and fries, but the chocolate shake was
  only 300-350ml and too sweet, skip that for \$7 next time.
  Overall I rate this more highly than Bunman, and at similar price giving 170g burgers it's the better choice IMO
- [Bunman](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z7w7qtZ1KSNKJySw9) - smashed burgers which as also like deep fried frazzled coming
  far out of the sides of the bun - 80g for \$7 or 160g for \11.
  The chocolate milkshake was only around 300-350ml and far too sweet and far too expensive for \$8, not worth it,
  don't get it again
- [Swirkies London](https://maps.app.goo.gl/36kgYVEvovmwfqa68) - \$5-\$6 for medium or large soft machine ice cream
  (what they call "merry cream" or Brits call "soft whip") and \$1 per topping.
  Expensive by international standards but it is open late so if you want late night ice cream this is one of the few
  options around midnight
- [Downtown Beirut](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7ykRbfKn6QauTNUA8) - usual international chain restaurants scattered around,
  but not that well structured

Not Recommended:

- [Beirut Central District](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rH77oWrxWtCQjNWx5) - a concrete wasteland of development and
  industrial units containing the odd sports club or casino.
  Skip this area in 2025/2026
