## Freelance

- [TopTal](https://www.toptal.com/) - preferred over UpWork, no time tracker, better rates
- [UpWork](https://www.upwork.com/)

## Remote Jobs

- [EuroTopTechJobs](https://www.eurotoptechjobs.com/)

Not Remote, but this might help:

## Digital Nomad

A person who works 100% Remote from any location they like,
such as tropical beaches or back home with their family roots.

## Offshore Payroll is Easy

There is no excuse for a company to not hire someone in another country or who lives as a Digital Nomad today,
they can just pay via one of these companies:

- [Deel](https://www.deel.com/)
- [Skuad](https://www.skuad.io/)
- [Wellwork Global](https://workwell-global.com/)

## Overseas Companies

### No UK Ltds - Boycott This

**Do not run a UK Ltd.**

It is high tax (25% corporation tax)
and they retained capital/assets on Companies House for anybody on the internet to see.

### US LLC

0% tax as a Non-Resident LLC as long as you don't hire anybody in the US, don't live in the US, and don't have a business address in the US.

Profits are paid out and taxes are handled in the resident country (UAE 0%!).

US LLC is useful to get access to US banking for things like selling online courses.
Charging from a foreign company such as in UAE may result in a bunch of declined card payments (eg.
from [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)), leading to sales attrition and loss of conversions.
People will also feel more comfortable buying from a US company than some random overseas company.

#### US Bank Account

- [Mercury](https://mercury.com/r/internet-made-coder-llc) - technically not a bank, but rather a fintech company.
  WARNING: Mercury uses partner banks, who de-risked causing thousands of client accounts being closed.
