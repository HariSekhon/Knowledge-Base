## Santa Ana

### Travel to Santa Ana

I took buses from Guatemala as I was working my way down Central America to South America.

I shopped around the tour operator shops in Panajachel,
Guatemala and managed to get from there to Antigua and then change to Santa Ana for a mere 450 GTQ
($58) which is almost certainly cheaper than any flight.

### Attractions in Santa Ana

The town itself doesn't have much in it, after an hour walking around the small centre with Santa Ana Cathedral you'll
want to go elsewhere.

The attractions are outside the town.

You can refer to [this local guide](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGerN-EUEc/YpGj1_h_8r2iWelBE8-K3A/edit) for
attractions and travel to nearby cities like San Salvador and El Zonte.

- [Santa Ana Volcano](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QiuRxZ2FfQupHJV26) - a 1 hour drive away, but you have to leave really
  early in the morning to take a shuttle or public but to get there before 11am for a guided tour.
  I'd just come down from Guatemala so was already volcano'd out
  and skipped on to Bitcoin Beach in El Zonte and the capital San Salvador

### Restaurants in Santa Ana

- [Comedor y Pupuseria Claudia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9cv1kzMFQiRfgyjC7) - shockingly cheap local eats restaurant with
  live music in the evening - recommended by locals - \$1-\$1.5 per Papusa, $2.50 for soft drinks.
  Papusa are pretty fattening though as a dough full of cheese with a little bit of meat or shrimp.
  WiFi 21/22 Mbit/s
- [Súper Selectos • Santa Ana Centro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/isbLkvAMVm3j8qgZ6) - supermarket to pick up groceries or
  household items
