### Travel to Santa Ana

I took buses from Guatemala as I was working my way down Central America to South America.

I shopped around the tour operator shops in Panajachel,
Guatemala and managed to get from there to Antigua and then change to Santa Ana for a mere 450 GTQ
($58) which is almost certainly cheaper than any flight.

### Attractions in Santa Ana

There's not much here, it's a 2 hour place with a small centre with Santa Ana Cathedral and a volcano of the same name
an hour's drive away.

If you've just come down from Guatemala you might already be volcano'd out and perhaps skip on to

### Restaurants in Santa Ana

- [Comedor y Pupuseria Claudia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9cv1kzMFQiRfgyjC7) - shockingly cheap local eats restaurant with
  live music in the evening - recommended by locals - \$1-\$1.5 per Papusa, $2.50 for soft drinks.
  Papusa are pretty fattening though as a dough full of cheese with a little bit of meat or shrimp.
  WiFi 21/22 Mbit/s
- [Súper Selectos • Santa Ana Centro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/isbLkvAMVm3j8qgZ6) - supermarket to pick up groceries or
  household items
