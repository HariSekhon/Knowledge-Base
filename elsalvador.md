## Santa Ana

### Travel to Santa Ana

I took buses from Guatemala as I was working my way down Central America to South America.

I shopped around the tour operator shops in Panajachel,
Guatemala and managed to get from there to Antigua and then change to Santa Ana for a mere 450 GTQ
($58) which is almost certainly cheaper than any flight.
