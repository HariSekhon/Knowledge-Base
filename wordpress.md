## WordPress Hosting

There are _lots_ of Wordpress hosting providers ranging in price.

Check out:

- [Wordpress.org's Hosting Recommended Providers](https://wordpress.org/hosting/)
- [Top10.com's Wordpress Hosting Comparison](https://www.top10.com/hosting/wordpresshosting-comparison)
- [Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=cheap+wordpress+hosting)

Watch out for intro deals that are cheap in the first year and then jack the price up on you in the second year.

- [BlueHost](https://www.bluehost.com/) - the open source Wordpress.org's recommended provider
- [Hostarmada](https://hostarmada.com/pricing/)
- [Verpex](https://verpex.com/)
- [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/uk/wordpress-hosting)
- [NamedCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/wordpress/pricing/)
- [IONOS](https://www.ionos.com/hosting/wordpress-hosting) - very cheap initially but becomes pricier upon automatic
  renewal
- [SiteGround](https://world.siteground.com/wordpress-hosting.htm) - same as above, cheap initially, then more expensive
- [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/vps)
- [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/en/hosting/wordpress-hosting)
- [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/hosting/) - expensive and not recommended since they deplatformed a well known
  men's blog, which means it's a censorship platform rather than a freedom of speech platform
- [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com) - expensive

This guy has done an interesting comparison video in late 2025:
