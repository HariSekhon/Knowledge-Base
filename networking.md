## CIDR visualizer

Shows bits, netmask, first IP, last IP, number of IPs in range.

<http://cidr.xyz/>

Especially those of you who never learnt to do your IP network calculations for your CCNA upwards.

## VPNs

See [VPNs](vpn.md).

## Browser Fingerprinting

[fingerprint.com](https://fingerprint.com/) can still sort of identify you using a hash of common characteristics.
Click the link from Incognito/Private Browsing and on/off VPN to see

Documentation:

<https://dev.fingerprint.com/>

Open source library (TODO read this code):

<https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs>

## I2P

<https://geti2p.net/>

Invisible Internet Protocol.

Anonymous internet network layer to route traffic through.

## Commands

```shell
ping 4.2.2.1
```

### Show routing table

On Linux:

```shell
route -n
```

On Windows or Mac:

```shell
netstat -rn
```

### DNS lookup

Look up a well known public DNS address:

On Linux or Mac:

```shell
host google.com
```

On Windows:

```shell
nslookup google.com
```

### Add static route

[man route](https://linux.die.net/man/8/route)

```shell
route add ...
```

[man ip-route](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-route.8.html)

```shell
ip route ...
```

### Show your public IP

...that you are NAT'd through as well as geolocation and other details:

```shell
curl ifconfig.co
```

### Linux - show your local IP Tables software firewall rules

```shell
iptables -nL -line-numbers
```

### Network Speed Test

#### Local Network Speed Test

Test your local network speed between two machines.

Start `iperf` server on one machine:

```shell
iperf -s
```

Run `iperf` client on another machine:

```shell
iperf -c "$ip"  # of above machine
```

#### Internet Network Speed Test

##### Speedtest.net

<https://www.speedtest.net/>

You can use it via:

1. Website
2. Apps
3. CLI

I find that I generally get significantly faster speed test results when:

- using 5G wifi networks:
  - perhaps due to less clients causing wifi contention since most customers are directed to use the default 2.4Hz
    networks
- running on Mac rather iPhone:
  - perhaps due to the stronger wifi card on my Macbook Pro

##### SpeedTest.net App

I've started using this more because the app on iPhone and Mac records the speed test results along with which wifi
network you were on at the time.

This is useful to keep a record to check back and it's also both easy to use and gives a nice GUI speedometer as well
as jitter graph.

<https://www.speedtest.net/apps>

##### SpeedTest.net CLI

[:ctocat: sivel/speedtest-cli](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli)

On Mac:

```shell
brew install speedtest
```

or generically

```shell
pip install speedtest-cli
```

If installed via [Homebrew](brew.md) on Mac:

```shell
speedtest
```

If installed via Pip:

```shell
speedtest-cli
```

Output at one of my favourite cafe's in [Vietnam](travel.md#vietnam):

```text
Retrieving speedtest.net configuration...
Testing from xTom (45.14.71.20)...
Retrieving speedtest.net server list...

Hosted by xTom (Osaka) [0.00 km]: 143.447 ms
Testing download speed................................................................................
Download: 21.80 Mbit/s
Testing upload speed......................................................................................................
```

Add the `--share` switch to generate a URL to an image

```shell
speedtest-cli --share
```

```text
Retrieving speedtest.net configuration...
Testing from xTom (45.14.71.20)...
Retrieving speedtest.net server list...

Testing upload speed......................................................................................................
Upload: 10.67 Mbit/s
Share results: http://www.speedtest.net/result/17241162768.png
```

Sometimes this fails with the following error:

```text
Retrieving speedtest.net configuration...
Cannot retrieve speedtest configuration
ERROR: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden
```

in which case this might help:

```shell
speedtest --secure
```

or just use [the website](https://www.speedtest.net/), which still works in that scenario.

An alternative CLI for speedtest.net can be found at

[:octocat: sindresorhus/speed-test](https://github.com/sindresorhus/speed-test)

```shell
npm install --global speed-test
```

```shell
speed-test
```

##### Fast.com

<https://fast.com>

Internet speed test by Netflix

[:octocat: sindresorhus/fast-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/fast-cli)

```shell
npm install -g fast-cli
```

```shell
fast-cli
```

or if installed without the `-g` global switch:

```shell
~/node_modules/fast-cli/distribution/cli.js
```

Does download speed by default, use `--upload` switch for upload speed.

Optionally use `--json` switch to output in [JSON](json.md) format.

```shell
./node_modules/fast-cli/distribution/cli.js --upload --json
```

```text
{
        "downloadSpeed": 210,
        "uploadSpeed": 18,
        "downloaded": 300,
        "uploaded": 80,
        "latency": 74,
        "bufferBloat": 131,
        "userLocation": "Osaka, JP",
        "userIp": "45.14.71.20"
}
```
