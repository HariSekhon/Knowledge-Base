## Driving in North Macedonia

It took **3 hours** to get through the Albanian - Macedonian border.

**Beware: UK car insurance only covers the EU and one or two other countries like Switzerland and maybe Serbia, but**
**NOT North Macedonia**.

**Border police said every UK insurance is not valid there, only in EU -
so they specifically challenge every British car and when I checked the small print they were
right (probably similar for all EU cars, which is why the border queue takes so long).**

**The border police held my passport and forced me to go buy insurance specifically for North Macedonia from a 24 hour
office on site - €50 for 15 days - almost twice the price of my regular insurance - a relatively high insurance premium
for my ignorance and being caught out by small print!**

Street Lighting -
most of the country's roads outside the cities are not lit,
even the motorways and main trunk roads across the country so you'll need to drive with your beam on.

Single Lane - most of the roads between Ohrid in the south and Skopje in the north were single lane, so
I was frequently getting stuck behind slow lorries or coaches, and overtaking is very difficult and dangerous here.

There is no e-Vignettes online toll like in several other European countries,
but there are toll booths on motorways that accept cards - it's roughly 50p per toll -
I got hit with 3 or 4 of them between Ohrid and Skopje,
but they're more of a stopping inconvenience than a substantial cost compared to Poland where you can pay an outrageous
€10 for a single toll crossing or some other European countries where you can pay €10-20 for an online pass.

## Skopje

[Skopje](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HsirTdkXtsbqHKRg7) (pro-nounced Sko-pyeh) is the capital of North Macedona, in the
north of the country near the Serbian and Kosovan borders.

ps. where is _"South"_ Macedonia - they must be hinting that Greece is South Macedonia!

- [Healthy Junk Food corner](https://maps.app.goo.gl/74q7p2rTzzRxg7ow7) - probably the best thing you'll eat in Skopje -
  healthy homemade naan wraps with succulent chicken and home made seasoning mixes, and cheap at only 215 mkd (€3.50)!
  They don't sell drinks at this time so bring your own from the neighbouring grocery store.
  This is a very unique proposition by a lovely married couple Maria & Nikhil mixing local and asian fusion who
  have really brought the magic of both taste and healthiness to their food - even the fries are air fried for
  healthiness. Try to get there before 4pm as they have a tendency to run out of their special home made naans that they
  use for the wraps because they prepare everything fresh the same day and don't want any wastage.
  The flame naanwich is their signature with the most herbs and spices,
  followed by the Heritage, and the Lemon & Herb is an easy choice for anybody.
  The Peri Peri is a bit spicy, but if you really like spice ask them for the spicy sauce on the side to dip or drip
  into your naanwich
- [Blueberry & Basil | Brunch & Coffee shop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LYh4owx9UitDTkiAA) - versatile brunch menu with
  mix of breakfasts such as Eggs Benedict and American breakfast, pancakes, yoghurt & acai bowls, salads, coffee and
  cakes.
  The Blueberry Basil pancakes were amazing - fluffy pancakes with blueberries,
  basil cream for contrast and lemon curd sauce for a sweet dipping base.
  The best pancakes I've had a long time.
  The ACAI bowl is small but nice.
  The cafe closes at 5pm, but the kitchen closes at 4pm so get there early in the afternoon.

- [The Brunch Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fAaLrch9qw7ybDiR9) - the 3 fried eggs on avocado toast was a good size and
  really hit the spot, and came with a bit of crispy streaky bacon the side. Has fresh squeezed orange juice pre-bottled
  by [markt.mk](https://markt.mk)
- [Brunch Healthy Foods & Snacks](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fCg1GCyF73zJKcN47) - cakes and freshly squeezed juices, not
  great seating though.
  The "carrot cake" looked like an orange topped cheesecake,
  but it was still good for 150mkd, and the Winter Flu juice was a really good juice mix for 150mkd
- [Urban Skopje](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KVa87SqEiNFxFMBc7) - coffee / juice truck stall in
  [City Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gYz6SMPGeKsmG93M8) - 150 mkd (€2.50) for a small freshly squeeze juice with ice,
  it's lower rating is probably because it's not as good value for money as the food at Healthy Junk Food corner,
  but is welcome relief on a hot day
- [Café Nomad](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9c6exiAbQ8GowMA9A) - freshly squeezed juices also in City Park
- [Chloé Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ygzUj18iwDVf3zmc7) - busy night drinking spot
- [Van Gogh Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wvwveR3K8pozkjD49) - refused to split the bill - bring cash
- [The Artist Pub](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sH1QBXEVcqU8VUz8A) - live music Wednesdays and Fridays, more of a food menu
- [Café „Hosh“](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tPwGwCNCiFDNgScD9) - 100 mkd fresh orange juice, cheaper than 150 elsehwere
- [Ла-Сди (La Sdi)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iZgQ1aW4fgw22jht5) - 24 hour grocery store - when you fany a late night
  ice cream or need some bottled water, or eggs for the morning
- [Macedonia Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3dx6RHXayFjP8aNp7) - tourist area
- [Old Bazaar - Skopje Old Town](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mCA6gtT7C1VmmEbN8) - must visit bazaar in the Skopje Fortress,
  with markets, shops and cafes
- [Diamond Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/toAywX1JLRho5bh37) - mall with designer shops
- [Ramstore Shopping Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MQA8bFYGrwE11c8YA) - lower key mall

Not Recommended:

- [Beer Garden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dsdzwQPsyRYf8gdn7) - ok for drinks but their chicken souvlaki skewers were raw
  in the middle in all three of our orders - do not eat here unless you want to get food poisoning, we had to leave our
  food and they still charged us for it.
  This is what happens when you let the group convince you to just eat here because they're hungry and can't wait

## Ohrid

TODO: after being stuck at the border for 3 hours I ran out of time to stop here.

Must revisit this for Lake Ohrid as the view of it was amazing in Pogradec, Albania.
