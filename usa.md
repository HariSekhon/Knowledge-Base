You will get finger printed entering the country.

I've worked up and down that Los Angeles part...

## California

California, the once golden place is not what it used to be after doubling its population from mass immigration.

Weather is great though, restaurants are decent (London's restaurants are better though).

Many of these places are only places to go on company expense as the hotels will set you back quite a lot per night.

Americans are now fleeing the failing Democrat state for Texas, which will then become the next domino to fall.

[In-and-Out Burger](https://www.in-n-out.com/) is a popular burger chain local to California, considered better than your
average chain by many locals.
The _"animal fries"_ covered in fried onions and gravy was too much even for me though.

### Irvine

A nicer more suburban manufactured city than LA, with decent shops and restaurants.

### Los Angeles

A giant square grid of blocks. From the plane it looks like The Matrix.

Hollywood boulevard is nothing fancy in the grand scheme of things.
It's just a tourist strip of a few restaurants and shops.

Rodeo Drive is the upmarket shopping road of expensive designer brands.

Beverley Hills are not as fancy as one would believe from Beverley Hills Cop movies.
More like a $1M+ middle class area.

[Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ](https://lucillesbbq.com/menu) is the best BBQ I've had in the entire world.
I've been searching for a BBQ place to match it across countries for over a decade now and nothing has come close.
The warm apple-cinnamon bun starters are amazing as are the giant beef ribs with the best BBQ glaze I've ever had.
My colleagues and I drove half way across LA to go to this because everybody knows it is the best.
If you're in LA or one of their expanded locations, do not miss it.
Looks like they now have a couple branches in Vegas and one in Phoenix, Arizona too.

[Crustacean](https://crustaceanbh.com/menu/) in Beverley Hills is a good upmarket seafood restaurant with fish in the
see-through floor as you enter. Impressive. Recommended if you want something a bit more upmarket.

### Palo Alto

A tech hub town with serious tech millionaire money, as evidenced by things like the McLaren showroom.

It was the first place I ever recall seeing a Tesla in 2013. When the traffic lights turned green,
for a moment I thought our car wasn't even moving relative to seeing it take off and leaving us behind in our
Infinity Q37.

Quite nice area, if you can afford it.

### San Diego

A somewhat more chill city than Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Restaurants were not that cheap though.

### San Francisco

Too expensive for even most of my engineer colleagues at Cloudera to live in.

There were homeless people on every block in 2013 when I was there. It's apparently much worse now.

Beware if you walk just one block west of the central shopping district you'll end up on the road of Tenderloin
which is full of drug addicts in broad daylight.
Walking through a group of 4 drug addicts on the pavement is not a pleasant experience
even if you think you could take them.
Not recommended for women.

[Boudin](https://boudinbakery.com/) is a local chain famous for its sour dough bread and soup in bread bowls.
