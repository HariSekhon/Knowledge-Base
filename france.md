# France

A surprising number of people in France do not speak English at all.

If you've been travelling to other countries where they often accommodate English speakers this might come as a
surprise for a country close to England.

## Dunkirk

Good for a stopover on your way to Beligum from the UK ferrying to Calais.

## Paris

*"A less good version of London"* as my colleague described it.

The capital is heavily immigrated from Africa, with lots of graffiti and not very nice metro.

I have literally been told off for not speaking French as a visitor. Much less welcoming than other parts of the world.

The many Chateaux outside of Paris in the French countryside are nice though
(I used to go every year with a company for retreats).
