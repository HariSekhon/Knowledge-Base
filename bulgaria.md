Not cheap any more, almost Western prices.

## Motorway Tolls - Vignettes in Bulgaria

Annoying road tax, but make sure you pay it to avoid more hassles from over bearing government.

The Vignettes toll booth guy told me to go to the Petrol station to pay instead, and something I couldn't understand.

Was easy to just book and pay using this app:

Make sure your [Mobile Internet Access](#mobile-internet-access) is going to work before going to Bulgaria,
or pay for it in advance online before you arrive.

## Sofia

- [Vitosha Boulevard](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8Sug4GPGr2pPUtEJ9) - north of the Google Maps pinpoint is where most of
  the restaurants and shops are
- [Constantinoff RestoBar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qMQnibX9Y3mfWhcJ8) - upmarket bar restaurant on Vitosha boulevard
  with great menu, moderate to high prices depending on what you order, but great venue and good vibe.
  The big horse sujuk (sausage) with herby sliced potato and red pepper is both good in taste and portion size.
  Take a date here. 54/70 Mbit/s wifi
- [Shtastlivetsa Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V18at2HgLF18vwpy8) - very good menu range, decor and ambience,
  one of the better places on Vitosha boulevard so international prices. The horse sujuk (sausage) is good, although
  the sweet potato fries were overcooked and charred, the small side salad was ok thought.
  This is a date place due to the ambience. 9/9 Mbit/s wifi
- [Lavelé Garden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DaAqVruKfe6LoKsW9) - upmarket restaurant on Vitosha boulevard.
  Brunch menu until 5pm. The Full Balkan Breakfast is very good (but then it should be for 22BGM! ~£10), and the bread
  in it is excellent, soft infused with olive oil / butter. Ask for an extra egg as it only comes with one
  (1.50BGN extra). Good music, like my
  [Upbeat & Sexual Pop](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/64OO67Be8wOXn6STqHxexr?si=tAH3h23xTvmxjAyDnGZQSA) Spotify
  playlist, shazamming lots. 7.5/92 Mbit/s wifi
  - [Lavelé Kitchen&Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EbyiN3C3QxN681Q46) - sister restaurant, but brunch menu only until 3pm
- [718 Breakfast & Brunch](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HJFmXxitMJcbuejz8) - gentrified cafe with western prices,
  obviously targeting foreigners. Has a reasonable acai bowl with banana, kiwi, granola, goji berry.
  The egg avocado sourdough toast was decent, but only comes with 1 egg
  (I ask for a second one for the protein, although this is overload and comes stacked as the sourdough isn't that big).
  The homemade passionfruit, basil and raspberry lemonade is good, but not worth the sugar for me, I'd rather have abs.
  11/16 Mbit/s wifi but was only getting 1.8/0.3 Mbit/s wifi when it was busy in the afternoon, making working difficult
- [Bistro Montanari](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RdUD2wSv1TECgPQN9) - very classic little bistro just off Vitosha boulevard,
  with lovely decor, laid back seating and 1930s style jazz music, reasonable food and drinks menu (3/4 alcoholic).x
  The bolognese was not as expected though, it had little meat and a penne like pasta instead of spaghetti, covered in
  parmesan. 13/44 Mbit/s wifi but the password is crazy long
- [StandArt Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/s6sunDXPuxSqpXFr6) - a little off the beaten track, but then good foodie
  places often are. They don't have the horse sausage any more, but the pork scallopini (3 thin steaks) in mouth
  tantalizing lemon & butter coating was excellent, it comes with salad, and although I asked for a side of mashed
  potatoes, I was served very crispy roasted herby potatoes, but they were also good too. 64/43 Mbit/s wifi
- [Beyond Brkfst](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hqeajmbxW4zLmkLG9) - eggs florentine (poached eggs with smoked salmon on
  sourdough toast) was decent, although the service was not good, but that might change. 282/113 Mbit/s wifi
- [Happy Bar & Grill](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qMQnibX9Y3mfWhcJ8) - popular chain restaurant with a good menu with a
  wide range of food from western to poke bowls, reasonable prices.
  The tuna and salmon poke bowl is an excellent healthy choice here for around 20BGN (~£8.70).
  There is also one on the 2nd floor of the [Mall of Sofia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SjtzPAjcTZ2mViKLA).
  10/10 Mbit wifi, no password
- [Attitude food&wine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/11FYx4eDPHxhbf1R7) - good menu, moderate prices. The beef pasta was very
  good and well presented, with small cubes of good quality beef,
  although I felt the portion size could have been a bit bigger as it comes in big white bowl with drizzle on the side.
  The fattoush salad was even better, with great crispy bread wafers, kalamata olives and great dressing -
  it's not authentic compared to middle eastern standards such as what you'd get in Dubai, but was excellent
  nonetheless. Even after eating both of these I could have kept eating,
  partly because the flavours were good and partly because the portions are not big.
  The chicken breast in cream sauce with mashed potatoes is decent too.
  35/33 Mbit/s wifi
- [Coffee Fellows](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BweDirYcGYyMQm2V6) - popular with good indoor and outdoor seating to soak up
  the sunshine and a view of the hills at the south end of Vitosha Boulevard.
  Unfortunately it's a bit pricey, with coffees costing around £4 and the 70/40 Mbit/s wifi requires a receipt
  login code valid for 1 device for 1 hour and even the toilet requires the use of the QR code on the receipt 🙄.
  The wifi uses a RADIUS server (I know because I received a radius server not responding error message), and it really
  does reject your code with an error `no more sessions allowed for user .....`
  when you try to reuse the same code on a second device. Not recommended for digital nomadding.
- [Staria Chinar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jwiUxptFTrMmm8o4A) - good Bulgarian restaurant, with lots of outdoor and
  indoor seating. The pork meatballs were reasonable, as side dishes the potatoes with dill and garlic were good,
  as were the grilled vegetables. Wifi was a bit sluggish, rated at 8/4 Mbit/s though
- [Serdika Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ucTqA8HWozq6QoUx7) - bigger better mall than the Mall of Sofia, with all the
  usual brands, but slightly farther from the center
- [Mall of Sofia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8KBGRr5h19BARadM8) - small provincial level mall but adequate with usual
  brands, hardly Dubai Mall, but then nothing is
- [Central Sofia Market Hall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fk1b6RSupbk19WpT9) - the WholeFoods of Sofia, very gentrified, but
  with prices to match

## Veliko Tarnovo

The historical and cultural capital of Bulgaria.

Stopped over driving between Sofia and Bucharest.

You don't need more than 1-1.5 hours to walk around here.

It seems the nicest part is East of the Google pin for the city, between
[here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TZmvGQTHSBsuA65LA)
and up the hill of small boutique stores
[here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TZmvGQTHSBsuA65LA),
although [Marno Pole Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nsJpoJzRcE9YvMmv5) is small and nice too.

There are plenty of well rated restaurants here, these are just the ones I tried, there may be better ones:

- [Hedo fun bar & restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N38mUkRnepd3kf9A9) - go downstairs to the restaurant on the park
  for a nice al fresco dining experience. The pork tenderloin with peppercorn and creme sauce with a few mushrooms was
  good, but left me hungry, so I couldn't resist the American Pancake place below. 25/72 Mbit/s wifi, no password
- [Pantastic](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hJgf1Fjv2yymw1CD8) - American pancake chain - had the tropical pancake stack with
  pineapple, desiccated coconut and flake almonds, was good, although I thought the pancakes were a bit soft.
  [Upbeat pop music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/64OO67Be8wOXn6STqHxexr?si=tAH3h23xTvmxjAyDnGZQSA) was playing,
  with some shazam-worthy songs. Amazing 285/155 Mbit/s wifi, password is on the wall

## Ruse

My second stopover town in the north of Bulgaria on the way from Sofia to Bucharest.

You don't need more than 1-1.5 hours to walk around the center.

- [Good Food Vintage show cooking](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5xwypazYNioVo9yN6) - the food here is really good, the menu
  has a good range of options, it's in a central location, and busy with good atmosphere.
  It's moderate to pricey depending on what you order.
  The traditional National Bulgarian dish of pork cubes with vegetables in sauce is really good,
  and reasonably priced.
  The 'Snezhanka' strained yoghurt 'salad' starter is very good too, containing chopped cucumber
  (order it with garlic!), it's similar to greek Tzatziki, and comes in 3 balls like ice cream, sprinkled with
  crushed walnuts, with each ball topped with a Kalamata olive.
  If you want more of a salad-salad, try a classic shopska salad or one of the others
- [Happy Bar & Grill](https://maps.app.goo.gl/y9DaSZ5ZA8kpBsX46) - popular chain restaurant, same as in Sofia,
  tuna & salmon poke bowls, teriyaki beef with rice, sushi, good range of options
