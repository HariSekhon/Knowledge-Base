# Alpine

<https://wiki.alpinelinux.org>

Minimal Linux distribution used mainly to create small Docker images.

Uses `busybox` all-in-one binary with minimal core shell and coreutils functionality.

Replaced `libc` with `musl` core library which sometimes causes problems with progam compiling or grep buggy behaviour.
