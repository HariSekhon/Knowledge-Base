## Immigration Control & Exit Flight Required

An exit flight is required before airlines will let you check-in (Copa airlines enforced this),
similar with many other latin american countries.

Immigration control took 1.5 hours of queuing at Medellin airport.

## Bogota

The capital.

The best area to stay in the touristy area of
[Zona T](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WHpYx3ZKv2XZjKva7) or
[El Chicó](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tdNXfQwNjwZRi9Zn8) slightly north of it.

## Travel Between Bogota and Medellin

Direct flights for 1 hour are so cheap that it's not worth taking a bus for 9-10 hours for only a few dollars less.

## Medellin

### Medellin Airport

#### Immigration Control

The immigration control queue took 1.5 hours.

They require:

- passport
- flight ticket in
- accommodation including address
- your telephone number

They did not ask for an exit flight, but the Copa airline check-in enforced this.

### Travel between Medellin Airport and Medellin Centre

This is 35 minutes outside Medellin.

It's quick and easy to take the Combuses mini coaches from immediately outside arrivals, the first exit on the right.

Tickets are sold at a booth just past the immigration control, before customs control scans your luggage upon arrival.
but you could probably also buy one on-board
if you've missed that before customs as they have a sign that tickets are \$17
and it seems you can pay in dollars or local currency.
It appears some people paid in cash upon arrival to Medellin,
while others like me gave their prepaid ticket to the driver.

I then used an Uber for the last 2km for a mere £3,
which was an official small yellow taxi hatchback that worked out cheaper than the other options on Uber, but
beware the boot was non-existent so I had to put my large suitcase on the back-seat and sit in the front -
this may be a problem if there are are two of you travelling, in which case you'll need to take one of the more expensive Uber car variants with more space.

### Restaurants in Medellin

<!--

[Vida Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jT9YJmb5Bgjhq4SW7) - surprisingly nice, bit more like a hotel, has a kitchen terrace on the top floor with wifi
64/79 Mbit/s

[Viajero Hostel Medellín & Rooftop Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/X6MfiQuzkTjbkiVb8) - party hostel, was booked out

-->

- [The Altar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KthCTQSBbE1v73L3A) - affordable excellent Mexican tacos, open late until midnight.
  I particularly liked the asada, birria, chicken, and shrimp tacos and tuna tostada.
  I'd skip the Watermelon juice next time though as it's watery and sometimes leaves one feeling bloated
  (not the 7 tacos and tostada I had! All that food came to £17 in Dec 2025)
