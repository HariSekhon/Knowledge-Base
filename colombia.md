## Immigration Control & Exit Flight Required

An exit flight is required before airlines will let you check-in (Copa airlines enforced this),
similar with many other latin american countries.

Immigration control took 1.5 hours of queuing at Medellin airport.

They required:

- passport
- flight ticket in
- accommodation including address
- your telephone number

The immigration officer did not ask for an exit flight,
possibly because they know the airlines check-in enforce it already.

## Bogota

The capital.

The best area to stay in are the touristy areas of
[Zona T](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WHpYx3ZKv2XZjKva7) or
[El Chicó](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tdNXfQwNjwZRi9Zn8) slightly north of it.

## Travel Between Bogota and Medellin

Direct flights for 1 hour are so cheap that it's not worth taking a bus for 9-10 hours for only a few dollars less.

## Medellin

### Medellin Airport

The airport wifi network has a simple captcha without needing personal details other than your country
and accepting the basic terms and personal data handling.

The speed is very good at 227/224 Mbit/s download/upload.

However, it only offers your 1 hour of free wifi and after that they try to get you to pay \$4 (as of Jan 2026)
so make well timed use of your internet if you are at the airport for 2-3 hours -
especially considering you will do check-in, then security scanning and then waiting by the gate - so you might want to
wait until you settle in the departure lounge, as I ran out of wifi time by the time I got to the departure lounge.

### Travel between Medellin Airport and Medellin Centre

This is 35 minutes outside Medellin.

It can take an hour in traffic or if you take public transport so leave more time when heading back to the airport.

Upon arrival it's quick and easy to take the Combuses mini coaches from immediately outside arrivals,
the first exit on the right.

Tickets are sold at a booth just past the immigration control, before customs control scans your luggage upon arrival.
but you could probably also buy one on-board
if you've missed that before customs as they have a sign that tickets are \$17
and it seems you can pay in dollars or local currency.
It appears some people paid in cash upon arrival to Medellin,
while others like me gave their prepaid ticket to the driver.

I then used an Uber for the last 2km for a mere £3,
which was an official small yellow taxi hatchback that worked out cheaper than the other options on Uber, but
beware the boot was non-existent so I had to put my large suitcase on the back-seat and sit in the front -
this may be a problem if there are are two of you travelling, in which case you'll need to take one of the more expensive Uber car variants with more space.

On the way back to the airport I took an official taxi via Uber for 120,000 COP (\$32.50),
due to more reliable timing to catch my flight to Bogota, which wasn't that much more than the \$21 (\$17 + \$4)
I paid for the Combus + short taxi coming from the airport.

### Restaurants in Medellin

- [Zona Rosa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EahcyfAzT1BCDBHy7) - lots of bars & restaurants to eat around here, too many for
  me to have tried
  - [Provenza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UhyvPYbB4SYN3Qxz8) - restaurants strip
  - [Parque Lleras](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SDmy67YsVXFqkzC68) - nightlife hub with of bars & restaurants
- [Laureles](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4QVW8yURzCV6s5Hy8) - local-favourite district with relaxed nightlife & restaurants
- [The Altar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KthCTQSBbE1v73L3A) - affordable excellent Mexican tacos, open late until midnight.
  I particularly liked the asada, birria, chicken, and shrimp tacos and tuna tostada.
  I'd skip the Watermelon juice next time though as it's watery and sometimes leaves one feeling bloated
  (not the 7 tacos and tostada I had! All that food came to £17 in Dec 2025)
- [Restaurante Milagros Manila](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jwSuPjuiQw1ucd4b7) - the tacos were good, especially the chicken
  and pork ones with pineapple in them, and the burrito was decent, the nachos with it were very crispy home made style
  ones. A little bit more expensive than The Altar above but good too.
  Wifi 97/75 Mbit/s
- [Pigasus pig & Burgers laureles](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cSoxfpzPg66duvfR8) -
  good burger chain and reasonably priced for a burger and fries.
  The fries were a relatively small portion though.
  I tried the aphrodite burger, that fried cheese block thing on top was dipped in some thick sticky sweet sauce that
  was awesome - totally fattening but worth it.
  The 'green mango' drink they brought me was awful though,
  I had to sent it back, it was salty and artificial like a slushie - so I don't recommend those drinks.
  Also avoid those little Heladas sweeties they give you with the bill because you'll get the munchies from it and then
  go buy buy junk food at Exito. I deny this happened to me.
  This chain outlet was a bit quiet, you might want to try one of the other ones.
  Has wifi but it's a simple name + email captcha portal
- [Final Feliz](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6XUz6fFfTs8sFkhC7) - co-joined with the reception of the popular Viajero hostel.
  The burgers are decent but the bacon is more like super fatty pork rib, avoid next time. The wedges are few in number
  but very good due to the sweet dusting, although they put too little of it on my wedges the second time around.
  The cheeseburger was pretty basic but ok for the price.
  Smoothies weren't available the first time, but I managed to try the coconut kiss smoothie the second time and it was
  worth it. WiFi 74/68 Mbit/s
- [Santafé Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KqKrkQez4uDy5JcY8) - large 5 story mall with a mix of the usual international
  brands and local stores, and a food court.
  Dog friendly, many people bring their dogs here.
  Has wifi but it requires a capture portal which didn't render for me
- [Oviedo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QapEjSqe3Rnx2yPJ9) - large mall
- [El Tesoro Parque Comercial](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xhrbE1QtoAsS2A7y5) - mall a bit further east
- [Éxito Wow - Poblado](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gDT3hxUPTbJmXoMv6) - good selection but expensive for foreign items like
  shaving cream, go to below D1 for that instead
- [D1 poblado 43D](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ftM9uTPp2zNBLgAZ6) - budget supermarket, cheap shaving cream compared to
  Exito (6,000 vs 46,000 Colombia Pesos - \$1.70 vs \$12)
  - [Tiendas D1](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UJB6vEKrYnKdcCpv5) - same D1 chain, small budget supermarket near many hostels
    for convenience

TODO:

- [Mamasita Medallo sede Poblado](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BwpKRe74ZM37AEVo6) - 4.7 Colombia, recommended by another
  tourist as the best place he'd eaten in Medellin, with the slow cooked beef cheek, probably in mole or a stew.
  Soups were apparently incredible too
