# Blogging

Blogging is such a Web 2.0 cliche, see this classic video:

[![Richter Scales Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/I6IQ_FOCE6I/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6IQ_FOCE6I)

... but at some point many people will want to blog about their favourite hobbies,
travel or whatever.

## Blogging Sites / Software

- Medium.com - you can see mine at: <https://medium.com/@harisekhon>
- Wordpress - the most popular blogging software by a mile, runs approximately 40% of all websites on the internet
  - [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com) - hosts free wordpress blogs, but beware they can deplatform you if you say
    something they don't like - there was a famous men's blog that was deplatformed
    (you cannot trust big tech comparnies) ... which leads on to either hosting your own...
  - [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org) - the free open source software you can run yourself or hire a hosting
    provider to run for you cheaply
    (just maintain regular backups in case they deplatform you so you can restore elsewhere)
    - See the [Wordpress](wordpress.md) page for tips including cheap hosting providers
    - I have done at least one company hiring test administering a wordpress site when I had no experience at all in
      this software (I figured it out and passed at the time)
- [Blogger.com](https://www.blogger.com/) - Google-owned, easy to use, but smaller user base and limited customizability
- [Ghost.org](https://ghost.org/) - another open source CMS (Content Management Sysstem),
  like Wordpress, but markdown first
  - [Ghost vs Wordpress](https://ghost.org/vs/wordpress/)
- Static Site Generators - eg. Jekyll, Hugo, MkDocs - popular with developers since you generate the sites from source
  code
  - see the [Markdown](markdown.md) and [MKDocs](mkdocs.md) pages for relevant tips

## Do not blog on LinkedIn

1. It is an oppressive censorship platform
1. You have to be logged in just to read and article, limiting its reach
1. Their article editor is inferior and has serious bugs that will lose your work.
   I lost a large article on the
   [UK Decline](https://medium.com/@harisekhon/the-uk-decline-what-i-learnt-from-my-uk-tour-2024-84347efced9b)
   which caused me to switch to Medium.com instead.
