### Best Areas to Stay in Quito

### Mariscal Sucre Quito International Airport

[Mariscal Sucre Quito International Airport](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bGBeV6Vt89WdAev26) is a small airport and
unfortunately neither of the two power sockets I tried worked to recharge.

### Terminal Terrestre Quitumbe - Quito Sur

[Terminal Terrestre Quitumbe - Quito Sur](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Gwk2G2ouYWNRAUU78) is the bus station hub to many
destinations in Ecuador.

There are a confusing number of ticket booths so leave yourself a good 45 minutes to orient yourself and ask around for
the destination you need. They are split by sections, some going to the coast, others the highlands etc.
In each region section of booths many different bus vendors are there with different schedules and prices.

I managed to connect to a free wifi network `WIFI_EPMMOP`, although not the expected one
(always a slight risk to connect to an unknown / unexpected network, make sure your laptop's firewall is enabled),
but there were no power sockets that you'd usually find at airports and bus terminals these days.

There are no power sockets anywhere that I could see,
there is a stall near the barriers to the platforms that charges \$0.50 to recharge per 1 hour.

There were also stray dogs wandering around looking for food
as there is a _"food court"_ (2 small cafe stalls) near the platform barriers on the upper level.
I think one guy had a confrontation with one to the side of me,
he looked like it had bitten his forearm sleeve but he wasn't hurt.

I was tempted to get some food here, but thought this might be tempting fate to get an upset stomach before a 9 hour bus
ride.

## Travel Between Quito and Montanita

Two options:

1. Fly to Manta and then take a bus or taxi to Montanita
   1. Taxi could be \$100 though (update: I tested using my favourite cheapest InDrive taxi app and it was only \$50
      cash)
1. Bus from Quito to Montanita (~ 9 hours)
   1. from bus station [Terminal Terrestre Quitumbe - Quito Sur](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Gwk2G2ouYWNRAUU78)

I tried the second option on a Saturday as I had an early flight arriving in Quito at midday, so even with the 1 hour
taxi to the bus station, I thought I'd have an afternoon of hourly buses to choose from, which turned out to not be the
case - there was only a single bus going at 7pm for \$18, so I ended up stuck at Terminal Terrestre Quitumbe for 5 hours
waiting for that only last bus option.

I used the bus company _"Cooperativa De Transporte Terrestre Carlos Alberto Aray"_.
The bus itself had large comfortable reclining seats to sleep in overnight,
but no power sockets so make sure you have a fat power bank if doing this run,
at least 20,000 mAh just for your phone recharges, more if you're using a laptop.

Update: after about 4 hours I noticed there are classic USB sockets built in to on the bulkhead above
by the air conditioning (the seats were so comfortable I fell asleep within 5 minutes and woke up at nearly 11pm).
Of course I my cable was the more modern USB-c to USB-c, then I remembered that I had a small pack of USB format
converters this worked. It needs to be a 2M cable though, 1M might not quite reach.
The power was 15 Watts measured, not quite enough to keep a busy laptop alive indefinitely, but enough to slow the
power drain by several hours, which is sufficient.

At the first stop (that I noticed as I woken up at least) at Santo Domingo, there were bathrooms and a few street snack
vendors, but also several people came on board to try to hustle, beg, sell USB power banks etc. This seems to be common
across Latin America.

If I had to do this again,
I'd fly to Manta and then bus or taxi only the remaining shorter distance which is only 45km instead of 600km.

### Travel Between Montanita and Manta / Quito

On the way back I decided to fly from Manta, the nearest airport, back to Quito.

However, Manta is not close to Montanita at all.

The bus from Montantita takes a solid 4 hours of driving to get to Manta (it's 3 hours in a car without stops)
but the bus is slower and stops along the way.
That small 300ml coconut water you have at the start of the journey will come back
to punish you with a vengeance by the end of the journey.

The bus runs roughly once an hour and you wave it down on the main road heading north.

The bus terminates at
[Terminal Terrestre de Manta - Luis Valdivieso Moránn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BUEX7ckoPCFB28HC7)
which is about a 20 minute walk, but in the Ecuadorean sun I recommend taking an Uber taxi for 3 minutes
instead, it only cost me \$1.70, although I had to walk across the parking lot to the highway to its meeting point,
but better than than dealing with yellow cab taxi drivers trying to price gouge you).

### Manta Airport

[Manta Eloy Alfaro International Airport](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uwEDskrBrFHdQn3M9)
is very small, with only a single coffee stall in the corner with drinks, sandwiches and desserts -
all with no prices, hmmm.

## Montanita

Beach town destination popular with surfers and backpackers.

It's small enough that you don't need to worry about which area to stay in as it's only about 10-15 minutes walk across
town, so just pick somewhere nice that is close on Google Maps to the town and then enjoy the beach and walking around.

Food in Montanita is both good and cheap as it's a little touristy,
but not so much they can get away with taking advantage.

### Restaurants in Montanita

- [Rose's Burger](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PpTrT1Na6rZyrxyy5) - I’m shocked how good the Rosa burger is, so flavourful
  and well balanced. They must have put drugs in it or something. The fries were the non-crispy medium-thick style,
  and passion fruit juice with lemon good too.
  More expensive than the street stalls selling burgers but it's so good and has a big menu of burgers,
  and is open late until 2am.
  The only downside is that 3 flying cockroaches or locusts or something landed on me in a row,
  probably due to the open front store and it being nearly midnight.
  WiFi 202/227 Mbit/s
- [Calle de los ceviches](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hhD6KY6cEjDJZ9VY6) - street food vendor with
  good fresh seafood ceviches with shrimp, octopus, fish, and oyster for \$8 - \$10.
  In hindsight I'd go with the \$8 instead of being upsold to the \$10 for 1 oyster on it
- [Tía Montanita](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cFr1XeYJPsaaXbck7) - medium-sized supermarket with a good selection of
  products
- [TuTi Montañita](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RNhe7Am2tsC5J9PC6) - smaller budget style supermarket, marginally cheaper
  but cash only
