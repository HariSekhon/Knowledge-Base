The capital.

TODO

### Mariscal Sucre Quito International Airport

[Mariscal Sucre Quito International Airport](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bGBeV6Vt89WdAev26) is a small airport and
unfortunately neither of the two power sockets I tried worked to recharge.

### Terminal Terrestre Quitumbe - Quito Sur

[Terminal Terrestre Quitumbe - Quito Sur](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Gwk2G2ouYWNRAUU78) is a hub to many destinations in
Ecuador.

There are a confusing number of ticket booths so leave yourself a good 45 minutes to orient yourself and ask around for
the destination you need. They are split by sections, some going to the coast, others the highlands etc.
In each region section of booths many different bus vendors are there with different schedules and prices.

I managed to connect to a free wifi network `WIFI_EPMMOP`, although not the expected one
(always a slight risk to connect to an unknown / unexpected network, make sure your laptop's firewall is enabled),
but there were no power sockets that you'd usually find at airports and bus terminals these days.

There are no power sockets anywhere that I could see,
there is a stall near the barriers to the platforms that charges to recharge.

There were also stray dogs wandering around looking for food
as there is a cafe near the platform barriers on the upper level.
I think one guy had a confrontation with one to the side of me,
he looked like it had bitten his forearm sleeve but he wasn't hurt.

## Travel Between Quito and Montanita

Two options:

1. Fly to Manta and then take a bus or taxi to Montanita
   1. Taxi could be \$100 though (update: I tested using my favourite cheapest InDrive taxi app and it was only \$50
      cash)
1. Bus from Quito to Montanita (~ 9 hours)
   1. from bus station [Terminal Terrestre Quitumbe - Quito Sur](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Gwk2G2ouYWNRAUU78)

I tried the second option on a Saturday as I had an early flight arriving in Quito at midday, so even with the 1 hour
taxi to the bus station, I thought I'd have an afternoon of hourly buses to choose from, which turned out to not be the
case - there was only a single bus going at 7pm for \$18, so I ended up stuck at Terminal Terrestre Quitumbe for 5 hours
waiting for that only last bus option.

If I had to do this again,
I'd fly to Manta and then bus or taxi only the remaining shorter distance which is only 45km instead of 600km.

## Montanita

Beach town destination popular with surfers and backpackers.
