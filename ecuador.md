## Summary

I used Nomad e-sim in Ecuador as it was the cheapest for 1GB for 7 days.

## Travel Between Quito and Montanita

Two options:

1. Fly to Manta and then take a bus or taxi to Montanita
   1. Taxi could be \$100 though (update: I tested using my favourite cheapest InDrive and it was only \$50 cash)
1. Bus from Quito to Montanita (~ 9 hours)
   1. bus station Terminal Terrestre Quitumbe - Quito Sur

I tried the second option on a Saturday as I had an early flight arriving in Quito at midday, so even with the 1 hour
taxi to the bus station, I thought I'd have an afternoon of hourly buses to choose from, which turned out to not be the
case - there was only a single bus going at 7pm for \$18, so I ended up stuck at Terminal Terrestre Quitumbe for 5 hours
waiting for that only last bus option.

If I had to do this again,
I'd fly to Manta and then bus or taxi only the remaining shorter distance which is only 45km instead of 600km.

## Montanita

Beach town destination popular with surfers and backpackers.
