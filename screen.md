## Key Points

- horizontal and vertical screen splitting
- built-in serial and telnet support which [tmux](tmux.md) lacks
- status bar requires [config](#screen-config)
- dynamic term titles requires [config](#commands)

Several Linux distributions are moving to [Tmux](tmux.md) which is another newer alternative.

### Tip: embedding multiplexers

You can run one terminal multiplexer inside another.

eg. on a remote SSH session inside another multiplexer on your local machine.

By using screen at one layer and [tmux](tmux.md) at another, you can avoid embedded keybindings clashes and having to double escape
keybindings all the time to send them through to the embedded multiplexer.

## Commands

Start a basic screen session:

```shell
screen
```

`Ctrl-a w` after this command to show the status bar to see you're inside screen.

List running screens:

```shell
screen -ls
```

- Start screen with options:
  - `-D` - detaching it from another terminal
  - `-R` - and reattaching it here
  - `-A` - adjusting the height and width to the current terminal

```shell
screen -DRA
```

Multi-attach to an already attached screen (useful to screen your screen with colleagues' terminals to follow along):

```shell
screen -x
```

Open new screen pane at number `$num` or next highest available:

```shell
screen $num
```

## Screen Config

`$HOME/.screenrc`

Screen requires a good configuration to make it more usable, such as:

- showing a permanent status bar along the bottom to see which screen terminal number you're in
- dynamic term titles (what command each term is running)
- custom keybindings

([Tmux](tmux.md) has this by default).

## KeyStrokes

`Ctrl-a` is the default primary keybinding action key prefix, followed by the next key.

Escape the shell key of `Ctrl-a` to jump to the start of the line by doing `Ctrl-a` , `a`.
