## Driving in Montenegro

**Beware: UK car insurance only covers the EU and one or two other countries like Switzerland and maybe Serbia, but**
**NOT Montenegro**.

**You will likely be forced to buy specific car insurance for Montenegro at a high price if you cannot prove you have**
**an insurance specifically covering Montenegro.**

The border police also checked UK MOT is valid
and may refuse to let you drive if it has lapse while you're road tripping overseas.

The Montenegro Riviera drive through the mountains is an impressive view, similar to Croatia's Dubrovnik Riviera,
winding mountain roads that look out of a James Bond movie, but it's not a drive for inexperienced drivers, as there are
sections without barriers where you could go off a cliff and die.

Also, due to the single lane most of the way, you can get stuck behind a slow lorry or coach,
and overtaking is very difficult and dangerous here.

## Podgorica

[Podgorica](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5sVEgxF13kdGi8tz5) is the capital and has cheaper accommodation than Budva, but
on first impression there isn't too much to do there as it's not well centralized.

However, after spending a few extra days, I was still discovering things.
You could cram it into 2 days, but only if you know exactly what you're doing:

[Independence Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9psMfsFUKkcn6UH99) gives a false impression there isn't much around it,
except for [Bokeska](https://maps.app.goo.gl/E1fu9DuAwUZPusg99) and
[Njegoseva](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rKJHSioefKvLU6HJ7) roads with bars and restaurants, but if you enter
[Njegosev Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xErfQQfGBnQCTJCv5) and
cross the [Gazela](https://maps.app.goo.gl/A15VotP6dyxsM3Ev5) bridge to the
[Kruševac](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bihaD7moCmrVgR2VA) district, near there is
[Orthodox Temple of Christ's Resurrection](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xag5hLnBwrAo2qTF6),
and a boulevard of designer shops on [Bulevar Džordža Vašingtona](https://maps.app.goo.gl/r9xoTnKvYy7XKoMv7) and then to
the South West the [Big Fashion Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fmCRpnKmQmakGR5S8), and
[City Kvart](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EtASfi6NuRtgJoem9) containing good restaurants, some of which are reviewed below.
Most of my favourite restaurants in Podgorica are all on or around City Kvart and
[Cetinjski Put](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FhwZ6sYMhnsSwhXY6):

- [SPAGO](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PcNvaneRfUHtPvYH9) -
  upmarket restaurant in City Kvart with excellent [menu](https://spagopodgorica.me/menu/),
  especially the exquisite and surprisingly reasonably priced dessert menu - probably the best dessert menu you'll find
  in Podgorica, if not all of Montenegro.
  The mains are not as cheap as the breakfasts and desserts, with the flank steak costing €33, but it was good quality,
  very lean and served with roasted vegetables, which left me space for dessert.
  It was hard to choose among the amazing dessert menu,
  which includes several rare and fancy homemade icecreams,
  crumbles, a whole cake collection (which unfortunately only come in whole cakes for special occasions).
  and their specials.
  The new Sne Nokle Twist special recommended by the waiter was surprisingly good -
  a variation on the traditional Montenegrin dessert
- [Arabian Tea House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tLVTzV92J8DqD75n9) - Dubai Emirati restaurant by the Big Fashion Mall.
  Good food, reasonable prices, and big juices, unlike stingy European places giving 200ml,
  theirs is 400ml, Dubai portion size for €4!
  The Arabian House Special Meat Wrap (beef) was good, with fries and a good garlic sauce.
  The fattoush salad was also good, better than it looked judging by pics of smallish pita pieces.
  Wifi 37/28 Mbit/s. This place made me miss being in Dubai
- [Independence Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9psMfsFUKkcn6UH99) - the couple roads surrounding Independence Square
  have a few restaurants like Diplomat below,
  and there are small electric toy cars for kids to drive in the tourist square
- [Diplomat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fc3bcaDWkyGAPjpP6) - upmarket restaurant with inexpensive prices,
  breakfast until 12:30pm, street food until 7pm, a good dinner menu and daily specials on Tuesdays and Thursdays 1-6pm.
  The complimentary bread starter comes with one flatbread,
  one cake-slice-like bread and one mini-muffin-like bread and 2 balls of spreads -
  one purple beetroot, garlic and cream cheese, the other an orange colour spicy paprika and cream cheese, both very
  nice.
  The veal cheeks in red wine with mashed potatoes was also very good.
  The veal came very tender and easily pulled apart, with 3 very large chunks of meat.
  There was a little bit of soft fat in between the meat, but not much.
  The sauce was not too winey (I prefer more!) and the mashed potatoes were good quality too.
  One of Thursday's two daily specials is meatballs with mash,
  but the meatballs were soft, indicating low meat content and quality
  and the sauce was also an orange colour rather than rich red tomato sauce.
  I don't recommend the meatballs.
  Overall a good food experience with good ambience,
  well worth the modest pricing, the only downside is their juices are typically European small 200ml
- [Ginger Gastro Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tWwU5aMaMtJ39LjYA) - the bbq burger was decent, with good fries, and the
  Ginger Mix juice was very strong with ginger and juice and also a good size, not too small like many European juices
- [Orthodox Temple of Christ's Resurrection](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xag5hLnBwrAo2qTF6) - fancy church, worth a visit
- [Njegosev Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yfg2v7FkzAEu3hTG9) - small but nice park with a walking bridge connecting to
  another smaller park on the other side of Podgorica on the way to Orthodox Temple of Christ's Resurrection, the
  designer shopping road and then south to the Big Fashion Mall
- [Big Fashion Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fmCRpnKmQmakGR5S8) - good mall with the usual Western brands, Cinema, and a
  few restaurants, and outside is the City Kvart area full of restaurants
- [City Kvart](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EoQGerQ7KSrTw1BA7) - area with lots of good restaurants opposite the Big Fashion
  Mall
- [Park Forest Gorica](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SchsssB6AsTKYe1g8) - lovely family friendly park with wildlife placards
  and play areas
- [Klub Bocara](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FL1ehvkYSyNnjNmn6) - a good stop for refreshing drinks after a long walk in
  Gorica park, popular among couples, with a nice outdoor terrace under a canopy of trees for shade, both alcoholic
  beverages and fresh squeezed juices, with reasonable prices
- [Voli](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XxGyfWdvDiYEy7ws9) - small centrally convenient supermarket to pick up daily groceries
  and fresh juices, 400ml for €2.10, which is half the price and twice the size of neighbouring restaurants.
  Was getting fresh squeezed juices every day from here, but alas it was closed on Sunday
- [HDL](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZFcW5oykr3RrUyxD6) - large cheap supermarket further out (use if driving)
- [Park Ljubović](https://maps.app.goo.gl/T2e9H7CmFYUHFrvu7)
- [King's Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tcG8RRQaS2yr5a6K6)
- [Karadjordjev Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DtoU21SRWTcGyjif9) - small but nice park with some bars to do pull ups
- [Petrovic Castle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gbtUCXB58qeiGThV7) - looks like a modest suburban house in other countries!

The [Travel Break](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dcFAx3ukzYcAbPbW9) hostel is run by a good and experienced guy, Miro,
and has a couple parking spaces for those doing road trips.
The only downside is that there is a 10:30pm curfew against using the outside seating area to socialize,
to not annoy the neighbours with noise of conversations, and that is the only social area available.
The gate is also locked at 10pm, but you have a key for that.

The [Travel Break Guide to Podgorica](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14AXWpoW47xmCzBQgdBlNr4N88Y90FJCX/view) has some
more useful recommendations to make the most of your stay in Podgorica, including restaurants, shops, travel, trains,
buses, taxis etc.

- [Konoba 'Lanterna' Podgorica](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ay3a8zq9tSr7ANadA) - highly rated, recommended to try the

## Budva

[Budva](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BTwu7AepwwxJJLs59)
is a popular beach town, and not very big, so accommodation is more expensive than the capital Podgorica.

- [Old Town of Budva](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ewqLZvi62Mj17gM68) - small streets in the fortress, with restaurants and
  souvenir shops
- [Pastabar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ncRF7J8B9A4XKCE4A) - the Seafood Pasta was good quality with large deshelled
  prawns.
  The Tika Masala pasta with chicken was decent too if you fancy something different.
  The orange juice, and apple & lime & mint juices were very good, fresh squeezed and a good size (~400ml), much better
  than the small 200-250ml juices often served in this region of Europe
- [Restaurant Porto](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dbVA175fTP5vhNHQ7) - good decor and food at reasonable prices.
  The best part was the house bread which came hot with a high quality fish pate.
  My friend ordered 3rds of it so I was dying by the time the main courses came.
  For seafood, the stuffed squid containing risotto and baby octopus in tomato sauce was good at €16.
  For meat, the traditional montenegro pork neck stuffed with parma ham, comes with fries was solid at €14.
  It is apparently the recipe of a president of the region from 100 years ago.
  The greek salad was a good size and quality of ingredients, especially for only €4
  The orange juice could have been bigger at only 250ml
- [Fluffy pancakes Budva](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fNGHmnxfiQs958pD8) - has ice cream at €2.50 per scoop - the
  passionfruit sorbet was the best most distinctive one here, and more creamy than watery as other sorbets often are
- [Moritz Eis](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fmpaoPZ5CtHfeeSV7) /
  [Moritz Eis Budva](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ce6upCjbMWtiX4Ut5) -
  decent selection of ice creams, €3.50 per scoop.
  I chose the tangerine sorbet as it was the most refreshing out the various flavours I sampled here
- [Populist Burger And Beyond](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bjX3NJK9un7QHLCH8) - the steak burger was very good,
  and comes with skinny fries for €17, the €4 orange juice was fresh squeezed in a tall slim glass.
  Unfortunately the fresh squeezed orange juice is limited daily supply and they ran out when I ordered a second one.
  No Wifi!
- [Školijera](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uvaFjr6bkS5RQRd1A) - cheap eats reasonable Gryros wrap place, open late
- [Home of Gyros by Naky's (Budva Setaliste)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hTPZE2AVbRhgXjih6) - ignore the low Google rating,
  this is a decent popular late night cheap eats with decent Gyros wrap, although not large

TODO:

- [Le Petit Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TD8L6yqFmmoJw8Ub7) - coffees, cocktails and cakes, open until late, good for
  socializing

## Kotor

[Kotor](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GsDU7TfnTqobkDp77) is a small historic fortified town with yachts, cruise ships,
and cats lounging around waiting to get petted by the many tourists on the small fortress
streets.

You will need just over 1 hour to wander around the fortress -
longer if you're stopping for coffee, shopping, dining, or attending the cats museum.

- [Kotor Old Town](https://maps.app.goo.gl/axtUTEmtTkYGy6to9) - in the fortress
- [Mon Bistro Cafétéria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q1Ao3cANc49JrsEh8) - nice coffee hop with outdoor seating with fans.
  They had cakes, including a pistachio cake of the day.
  The yoghurt, berry, granola cup with sachet of honey for €5 which was a yummy snack
- [Shopping Centre Kamelija](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gxVeouPK3PoNL13y5) - a small shopping centre with reasonably priced
  parking at €2 an hour, if you can get a space.
  The toilets in this mall even charge you €1 if you don't have a shopping receipt,
  so go buy a drink or something in the supermarket first to use its receipt to enter the toilets for free.
- [Kotor Cats Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sRLyBjuAPeBADQyw5)

## Bar

[Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6HxgncYoNrxoFNhz5) is a small seaside town, but the beach is not as good as Budva which is
much more popular.

- [KARUBA PIZZA & PUB](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HbpbUxpy6qZh9fk98) - decent menu but slightly touristy prices.
  The fresh squeezed orange juice was good and a decent size for €3 filling a 330ml glass, slightly more than Perbacco
  next door.
  The octopus salad was quite large, a serious main, but then it should be for €18, slightly less than Perbacco next
  door too.
  It contains a good amount of octopus tentacle, a lot of lettuce as well as cherry tomatoes, red onions and some
  garlic, but also a lot of green olives (stone in) which were at the very strong olive flavour end of the spectrum,
  probably too strong for the salad.
  If you're not a fan of olives, make sure you ask them to not add them.
