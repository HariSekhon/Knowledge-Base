## Taxis in Taiwan

My usual Grab which is popular in SE Asia isn't available in Taiwan, they have Uber and FindTaxi:

- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/tw/en/)
- [FindTaxi](https://apps.apple.com/hk/app/findtaxi/id1023750145?l=en-GB) - never received the SMS verification despite
  several tries so never used this. Ended up using my existing Uber app

## Taipei

Taipei was too urban for my liking after having toured other parts of SE Asia.

Taipei's structure is surprisingly spread out in an American size layout,
making it take a while to walk around and ages to cross the streets,
with long waits at crossings, and crossings giving 40 to 79 seconds to cross the 6-8 lane roads!

I don't see this region as having enough attractiveness or cost effectiveness to want to visit, which is why I see few
tourists here compared to other countries in SE Asia.

### Taipei Hotels

Taipei hotels can be more expensive than other destinations in SE Asia
and for some reason their check-ins only seem to be from 5pm instead of 2pm,
even when their checkout is earlier at 11am rather than 12pm.

### Restaurants in Taipei

This would be a longer list below but I didn't stay in Taipei for more than a few days,
as I prefer other parts of SE Asia, so you'll have to do more Google Maps / Searches yourself to find and try the rest.

- [Busan Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RJhrUyyLzeiC3F5R6) - very popular busy Korean restaurant with top notch
  food at reasonable prices, free red lemon tea and barley tea, as well as free water.
  The beef bibimbap was very good, a really complete nutrition meal with beef, egg, rice, vegetables and even glass
  noodles.
  It's been years since I had a bibimbap this good.
  It even came with a small miso seaweed soup with egg,
  although on my second visit they only gave me a sweetcorn soup with egg.
