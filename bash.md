# Bash - Shell & Scripting

This is the standard modern shell. You should always script in Bash for portability.

It's a rare exception where you'd need to script in the original Bourne shell
(bootstrapping [Alpine](https://github.com/HariSekhon/Dockerfiles/blob/master/alpine-dev/Dockerfile)
is one of the few use cases for that).

## Bash vs Other Languages

You may occasionally see the following in DevOps job specs:

> 10 lines of Bash is better than 100 lines of Java

This true, but also, if you're only writing 100 lines of Java you probably don't have enough error handling.

### Error Handling in Bash

All scripts should have the following set at the top of them.

If you haven't accounted for all the exit codes and variables in the script,
it should crash for safety like other languages until you fix your code.

```shell
set -euo pipefail
```

See the [Debugging](#debugging) section further down for details.

## Advanced Library of Scripts

1000+ DevOps Bash Scripts

AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD, APIs, SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Hive, Impala, Kafka,
Hadoop, Jenkins, GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, Azure DevOps, TeamCity, Spotify, MP3, LDAP, Code/Build Linting, pkg mgmt
for Linux, Mac, Python, Perl, Ruby, NodeJS, Golang etc.

Also contains advanced configs. eg: `.bashrc`, `.vimrc`, `.gitconfig`, `.
screenrc`, `.tmux.conf` etc.

This is more than the manuals above, you could study this repo for years, or just run its scripts today to save you
the time.

## Perl, Awk, Sed

You need to learn at least some basic one-liners of [Perl](perl.md), Awk and Sed to be proficient in shell scripting.

You also need to learn [Regex](regex.md) to use these tools effectively.

## JSON

See the [JSON](json.md) doc for commands to help with processing JSON which is often output by modern Rest APIs.

## Binaries Debugging

See the [Binaries Debugging](binaries-debugging.md) doc for commands to examine and work with binaries.

## Commands

## Tips & Tricks

Treat a process as a file handle to read from:

```shell
<(somecommand)
```

Treat a process as a file handle to write in to:

```shell
>(somecommand)
```

A neat trick is to `tee /dev/stderr` to have the output appear on your screen while also sending it onwards for further
processing in a shell pipeline.

```shell
echo stuff | tee /dev/stderr | xargs echo processing
```

Tee to two programs:

```shell
echo stuff | tee >(cat) | cat
```

### Fifos

Something that seemed cool in the 2000s was FIFO pipes (first in first out). These are special files that one process
can write into and another process can read from:

```shell
mkfifo /tmp/test.fifo
```

this hangs if there isn't another process reading from the fifo pseudo-file:

```shell
echo stuff > /tmp/test.fifo
```

in another shell:

```shell
cat /tmp/test.fifo
```

In practice, I can't recall finding a need for this since the 2000s. There usually better solutions.

FIFOs have no real security though and rely on file permissions to stop somebody or some other program writing unexpected
input into the listening program, which may not be coded defensively enough. In practice people just use temporary files
between processes not started in the same shell if they really have to. Situations which require long-running IPC would
probably be better done in a real programming language.

### Number Lines

```shell
cat -n
```

```shell
less -N
```

```shell
nl
```

### Miscellaneous Bash Bangs

- `!n` - re-runs command number `n` from the `history`
- `!$` - the last argument of the previous command, usually a filename from a previous command. Useful to run another
  command on the previous file operated on
- `!:n*` - takes the Nth arg to the end from the last command

### Flush Stdout Immediately

```shell
stdbuf -oL $command
```

```shell
script -q /dev/null $command
```

If `expect` package is installed:

```shell
unbuffer $command
```

For Awk:

```shell
awk '{ print $0; fflush() }'
```

For [Python](python.md) programs:

```shell
export PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
```

or

```shell
python -u "$script"
```

### Native Regex Capture

```shell
regex='([[:alpha:]]+)-([[:digit:]]+)'

if [[ "ubuntu-22" =~ $regex ]]; then

    whole_match="${BASH_REMATCH[0]}"

    word="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"

    integer="${BASH_REMATCH[2]}"

    echo "Whole Match: $whole_match"
    echo "Word Match: $word"
    echo "Integer Match: $integer"
fi
```

### Readline Support - `rlwrap`

Add readline support (command history - the ability to press `Up`-`Enter` to re-execute previous commands)
to tools that lack it like [Oracle](oracle.md)'s SQL*Plus.

Prefix any command with `rlwrap`:

```properties
rlwrap <command>
```

This works by intercepting user input and storing it and replacing it when you press `Up` or `Down`,
essentially giving you command history.

This is usually available in the `rlwrap` package on [RHEL](redhat.md) and [Debian](debian.md)-based Linux systems
and [brew](brew.md) on Mac.

## Debugging

### Shell executing tracing

Prints commands as a script runs so you can see what command generated an error:

```shell
set -x
```

### Fail on any error exit code

Fail if any command returns an unhandled non-zero exit code.

If you have unhandled errors your script should die so you know what the script is doing at all times and doesn't result
in unintended consequences:

```shell
set -e
```

In Bash, but not available in old Bourne shell:

```shell
set -o pipefail
```

Which fails on non-zero exit codes from commands in pipes
which otherwise get masked by the exit code of the last command in the shell pipeline.

### Fail if accessing any unset variable

This prevents commands running on typo variables or empty variables
(a variable set to the result of a command that returned nothing instead of the expected output) as that can have
disastrous consequences:

```shell
set -u
```

Imagine `rm -fr "/apps/$empty_variable"` which would delete all the apps instead of the expected one,
or worse on `/` would delete the entire operating system and all data on it.

### Clean Shell

Start a clean shell without any functions, aliases or other settings to help in debugging:

```shell
env - bash --norc --noprofile
```

In [DevOps-Bash-tools](devops-bash-tools.md) this a function called `cleanshell`.

## Style Guide

[Google Shell Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html) - I don't always agree with everything in here but here it is if you're interested

Points I disagree with the Google style guide on:

- 2 space indentation - Python already set the standard with 4 space indentation for ease of readability 20+ years ago
- 80 character width is also antiquated. 100 or 120 char width is probably fine for most people, you are unlikely to be editing scripts on an old 80 character console
- shell pipes should not all be on one line unless they're a trivial mere couple commands
  - because any changes will have a larger blast radius in trying to scan what part of the line changed
  - split command pipes one command per line for easier `git diff`ing showing the command that changed
- `${var}` variables surrounded by braces is only needed for variables that touch other strings and would otherwise be misinterpreted. You don't get paid to put in extra characters everywhere
- the Google guideline then tells you not to bother doing it for single character variables unless they touch another adjacent string, but doesn't follow this same logic for full word variables
- `[[` is more advanced and less portable than `[` - only use it when you need regex matching

## More Useful Commands

### Delete a trailing blank line of a file

[Pre-commit](pre-commit.md) CI/CD checks will fail if there are trailing blank lines.

```shell
sed -i -e '${/^$/d}' "$file"
```

On Mac, use GNU sed for compatibility, call `gsed` instead of `sed`:

```shell
gsed -i -e '${/^$/d}' "$file"
```
