## Taxi Apps

- [Cabify](https://cabify.com/en) - considered the top taxi app here with competitive pricing, but I've not tried it yet
  as the public transport from the airport was 1st world good.
- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/es/en/)
- [Bolt](https://bolt.eu/en/)

## Madrid

Spain's capital is not cheap but it is surprisingly nice, clean and gentrified compared to many other capitals
(even more so compared to other countries as I'd recently been to such as Tunisia, Jordan and Lebanon!)

There are a lot of nice monuments to see and lots of tourists taking pictures in front of them.

First impressions on the metro was that it was clean and efficient,
and the population actually looked Spanish,
so it appears they have much less mass immigration foreign replacement than back home in London.

The central tourist areas do have more foreigners as one would expect.

### Travel from Madrid Airport

You can take the 200 bus from immediately outside the door of exit 14 at Terminal 1 arrivals.
It goes to the metro station Avenue de America -
which only takes 18 minutes and a handful of stops for an affordable €1.50. It seems to come quite frequently approximately every 20 minutes.

There also appears to be a metro number 8 line from Terminal 4.

Of course both will be much cheaper than taking a taxi.

### Madrid Metro

The metro is also affordable, clean and frequent.

I paid €1.50 to go the rest of the way to the centre (Alonso Martinez).

Contactless card payments don't work on the barriers though,
you need a local travel card,
but this is not a problem as the automated vending machines have an English option
and will dispense a card with your single fare on it for an extra one-time fee of €2.50.

### Restaurants in Madrid

<!--

Safestay Hostel Madrid Central was decent, Wifi speed 31/58 Mbit/s,
but the queue to check in at 3pm took at least 40 minutes and there was still a queue when I came back at 7:30pm.
The reception guy said there is often still a queue at 6pm,
because they have people waiting from 7am to check in and they don't allow them until 3pm.

- [TKO Tacos](https://tkotacos.com/ubicacion/madrid/) - affordable tacos chain with a great mix of ingredients,
  including the usual beef, pork and chicken, but also octopus and cactus.
  The tacos are surprisingly cheap at €1-2 each, but they are also very small, so you need 5 of them per person.
  The _"cochinada"_ taco of smoked pork was one of my favourites in terms of distinctive flavour.
  The grilled octopus taco is twice the price at €4.20, and comes with a lot of white sauce.
  While decent, I would in hindsight get two other tacos instead.
  The _"chicken tinga"_ taco with spicy grilled chicken was decent.
  The cactus "nopales" taco is interesting for a vegetarian option.
  No wifi here unfortunately (probably on purpose so people eat and leave the venue as it's fairly small and popular)
