## Madrid

The capital, but expensive at an estimated £3300 nomad cost per month on [Nomads.com](https://nomads.com).

Madrid is surprisingly nice compared to many other capitals (even more so as I'd recently been in Tunisia, Jordan and
Lebanon.

There are a lot of nice monuments to see and lots of tourists taking pictures in front of them.

- [TKO Tacos]() - affordable tacos with a great mix of ingredients, including the usual beef, pork and chicken, but
  also octopus and cactus.
  No wifi though
