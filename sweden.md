### Sweden

Ferry from Tallinn in Estonia to Sweden and then another ferry down to Gdanks, Poland, is a way out if your license gets suspended for speeding in Latvia.

Police pulled me over coming off the ferry from Tallinn, Estonia,
and did a very invasive search of my car and all luggage, they opened everything, down to my toiletries and car bonnet.

#### Stockholm

The centre of Stockholm is ok for a day or two, probably not more. It's weirdly broken up into small island-like lands,
and lacks the impressive design and architecture of the central european capitals.
The girls are pretty of course.

The roads are not well designed and it's easy to take a wrong turn,
and parking in a problem in the centre, unlike Warsaw for example.

Do not stay in Kista. Mass immigrated and not one of the safest feeling places.
The Memory Hotel in Kista was cheap for a reason - it was absolutely dead in August like I have never seen before,
no staff most of the time or seeing other guests.

[Restaurang Kryp In](https://restaurangkrypin.se/) is good in the centre.
