## Summary

People cite wanting 'banking experience'.

When you finally get there, you find out there is nothing to it.

The key skill is not technical - it's tolerating a lot of red tape, BS, meetings, documents, wasted budgets and slow progress.

One large bank didn't even get their servers within 6 months, and had 10 managers for 9 engineers.

Fintechs are the future - they focus on tech, they're faster and are harder to work for technically.

Case in point: compare app-first banks which you can open in 10 minutes to legacy high street banks that tell you to
get an appointment weeks away.

When I was racing to open accounts to spread money for FSCS protection just before Brexit vote, this was the exactly
experience I had as a consumer.

Investment banks have a bit of technical jargon that it helps to know in conversation, although you probably won't be
working on anything actually needing this knowledge as an IT guy.
