## Interview Tips

### Pre-Interview Preparation

Spend at least 1 hour.

- Research the company - Google, [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/) etc.
- Stalk your interviewer's LinkedIn profile (but don’t connect)
- Spot a recent win or post
- Drop it naturally into the conversation to show you've done your homework and taken an interest

### First Impressions

The first 30 seconds set the tone.

- Be presentable (even on Zoom)
- Have good posture, sit tall
- Smile before you speak
- Mirror the interviewer's energy and pacing for balance, letting both sides speak back and forth for good converation

### The STAR Method

Situation, Task, Action, Result.

What did you do and what was the outcome.

another version:

Problem → Action → Result → Lesson.

Prepare 3 stories:

- Leadership
- Success
- Failure

Be able to deliver each story within 2 minutes.

### Composure

Pause before answering tough questions.

This shows composure and thoughtfulness, not confusion or rushing.

Thoughtful and measured beats fast and rushed.

### End Strong

Ask about their biggest challenges.

Link your experience to solving it.

Ask 2-3 good questions based on your discussions during the interview, I've given the first one above that I always use.

Be genuinely interested in the situation of their environment.
