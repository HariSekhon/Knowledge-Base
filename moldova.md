I've used Airalo and aloSIM e-sims in Moldova.

## Moldova Cash

Some of these less developed countries like Moldova and Morocco demand cash usage (probably to evade taxes).

You'll need to withdraw local currency before you leave the airport.

## Chisinau

### Chisinau Taxis

Do not use the Airport Taxis.

The first time I went to Chisinau there were hardly any taxis outside the airport and lots of people waiting around for
them.

The wall had written that taxis should be 150-200 MDL (Moldovan Leu - about €7-10) to the centre but when taxi drivers finally showed up
they started quoting me 300-400 (€15 - €20) and cash only.

After my experience in Turkey and this I have started to dislike how taxi drivers are taking tourists for mugs.

Use Taxi apps instead:

- [Yandex Go](https://go.yandex/) - this is the best one I've tried in Moldova
- [Letz](https://letz.md/) - more expensive than Yandex go
- [Uklon](https://uklon.com.ua/en/) - didn't receive the SMS verification code to sign up so couldn't try it

Even when using Yandex Go to get to the airport in time, I was in a rush and decided to just accept the "Pay by Cash"
option in the app.

This was probably a mistake.

I booked a taxi for 106 MDL (€5.50) to the airport, but the taxi driver immediately ended the app journey at 30 MDL as
soon as we started, and then tried metering me to the airport for 180 MDL instead.
I handed him the 110 MDL cash I had in hand and left before he could complain and try to scam me.

It's actually not about the money, it's about the insult and dishonesty.
In many other countries we pay more than this for a taxi, but we agree the price up front and it doesn't double on you
without consent.

### Chisinau Airport Bus

The first time the airport taxi drivers blatently tried to charge me double what the wall said the rate was
I ended up taking the Number 30 bus to the centre instead which was easy (again cash only, thanks to a good samaritan
the first time because I made the mistake of not withdrawing cash before leaving the airport the first time).

The second time I went to Chisinau I just ignored the taxi drivers and took the bus again.
The bus had since added card reading machines but they weren't working so I still needed cash.

The bus ride to Chisinau centre from the airport only costs 6 MDL (€0.30), which is almost free, although
you might have to pay 12 MDL (€0.60) to include your suitcase (or the price went up vs what Google Maps reported).

Some European countries like Czechia's Prague metro charges for luggage and the conductor charged me 12 MDL but it was
such a tiny amount I didn't bother to ask if this was for the luggage.

### Chisinau Restaurants

- [La Placinte](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6yVUsipRBWWSfpBp8) - affordable but good quality chain restaurant, there are
  several of them you don't have to go to this location

- [Andy's](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fewkr3FsDjW2rZfUA) - affordable chain known for pizzas,
  the central one is 24x7 and packed at midnight on a Saturday as one of the few late night places available.

- [Keller Holz Gastropub](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pr7sK1L7MnSwy5py5) - good food and beer menus, very good ambience and
  location

- [Sensei Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7vMPz3KZbppy3iudA) - good looking menu, little pricey by local standards,
  outside terrace, has wifi, good ambience but shisha smokey indoors

- [Cartal](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aDCJVHnDE2z2rWKQ7) - decent food, moderate prices, small indoor bar seating,
  all restaurant seating is outdoors, card ok until 10pm, takes only cash 10pm-12am closing time

- [Daily Dose](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LoncFKxbs6hvBCwJ6) - busy trendy late night cocktails and desserts venue,
  no hot drinks for late night workers

- [Amor Amar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EroDq4vsNi2Zzd78A) - trendy small late night drinks & dessert venue with good
  music, slightly expensive due to late night premium open until 2am

- [Grill House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WBD1c5GHKspgDf8A6) - established in 1995, decent quality, price `£££` -
  the traditional Georgian soup Kharcho with veal is slightly spicey but very good and much bigger than anticipated,
  watch out you can still handle your main.
  New York Cheesecake was good, and fillet steak was decent but far from the best I've had internationally.
  For non-alcoholics with a sweet tooth the local Compot fruit juice drink is recommended,
  I had 3 of them and was probably well over my sugar intake a result.
  Regarding, steak on a price trade off I'd probably try one of the other steak places next time.
