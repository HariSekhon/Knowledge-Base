### Laos

$40 for a visa on arrival, and long queues.
Expect to lose the day travelling to Laos even if you're coming from a nearby country like Cambodia.

Luang Prabang is nicer than Vientiane, it's more geared for tourists.

#### Taxis in Laos

- [Loca](https://loca.la/) - taxi app

#### Vientiane

- [Vientiane Night Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/m6UCkzUvghCNcHC99) - clothes, personal electronics, cologne, there
  are streetfood restaurant huts opposite by the water fountains,
  but they are a bit pricier than they should be, restaurants like Nuan below are better priced
- [525 Eat & Drink](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qioyRpu9E5vMFzME6) - upmarket restaurant and bar, not cheap, but great
  quality, the Seafood pasta was the best I've had in years, even better than The State of Pasta below.
  Great date night with dim lighting, great outdoor seating, an inside dining and separate bar area.
  Only 20Mbit/s wifi but then you shouldn't be digital nomadding from such a great venue!
  The banoffee pie was loaded with a large cream top and a biscuit base
- [Maysa Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ju2jqTJorbtzFPCJ7) - good prices, fast wifi.
  The meals like seafood noodles and seafood holy basil are great and only 50,000 kip. Closes at 5pm unfortunately
- [Nuan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rbBYKXNAC5AY9Xho8) - good food, prices and menu, 75Mbit/s fast wifi,
  but not comfortable metal chairs
- [Khop Chai Deu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1NJqQyrSRegyFKZF7) - bar restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating,
  open a bit later than other places until 11:30pm.
  The wedges with chilli garlic pepper are very good,
  grilled Lao beef with great spicy chilli dip, although the beef wasn't as good the second time around I had this,
  orange juice is good but half a wine glass, had to order 3 of them.
  Slow 3Mbit/s WiFi don’t try to work here.
  Moderately expensive, I paid $17 for an evening meal with OJs.
  Taro in coconut milk dessert probably wasn’t worth it
- [The State of Pasta](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nvBCkmMACSJJDWhB8) - good quality bologneses with parmesan,
  internationally priced as it caters to foreigners. Al Dente is very firm here.
  Doesn't have much in the way of a juice selection. Wifi is ~30Mbit/s.
  Closed on Wednesdays
- [Tango Pub Bar Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mckJunysGY3fuXR4A) - closed on Wednesdays
- [Common Grounds Cafe & Bakery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/g8KHsoJ4CVp69jHD7) - $3 juice isn't big,
  but the Wifi is fast 80Mbit/s
- [Chokdee Café Belgian Beer Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Phviu88WdaZz7G4z7) - selection of beers but not much choice
  for non-alcoholic.
  The Belgian fries were ok.
  Has food but used more as a drinking place than a food place.
  Wifi is slow at only 11Mbit/s
- [Naked Espresso Misay](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XZMpHLWDknPDpmbz9) - pricey and closes at 6pm, but
- [Café Sinouk Khemkhong](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9nY1cVa3yusjC4Rf9) - mediocre 35mbit/s wifi
- [Go Dunk](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DumQjpf88LN26HBp7) - bar with extremely loud live music, open until midnight,
  exclusively a young local crowd, 40Mbit/s wifi but you won't get any work done here
- [Mogul Gelato](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6rfpezdJ2NnPygK48) - $3 for 2 scoops is expensive by local standards but very
  good flaours and quality cones too.
  Has decent wifi, seating and plugs, located on the upper level of the
  [Naga Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eYW8sxmcnBivniAy9)
- [Naga Mall Vientiane](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eYW8sxmcnBivniAy9) - better than the
  [Vientiane Center Lao](https://maps.app.goo.gl/p4RuTRkuZ7HtMJes6)

#### High Speed Rail Between Vientiane and Luang Prabang

This fast modern train gets you between these towns in only 2 hours, and it's a smooth ride.

You can buy tickets online or at the [Laos-China Railway ticket office](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MqSshJ4oRcMiQLeJ7) in
the other unimpressive [Vientiane Center Lao](https://maps.app.goo.gl/p4RuTRkuZ7HtMJes6).

You'll need 600Kip per ticket (\$25). This is cheaper and easier than flying between the towns.

The [Vientiane Railway Station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5eGN8usMne4QYeKw5) is far out from the "centre" -
if Vientiane has such a thing - about 30 mins by taxi.

Similarly, you'll need a taxi to / from the [Luang Prabang Railway Station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xRL7bo2vSQeiXqzb8),
which takes just over 20 minutes.

#### Luang Prabang

Much more touristy than Vientiane, and more internationally priced except for the Night Market.

Many of these are tourist restaurants due to the area, and cash seems to burn faster here as it's easy to spend \$15 per
head for a basic meal and a drink.

- [Luang Prabang Night Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mJy55E28FsR9j2bN6) - 5pm onwards, the West end has a good food
  market that seems to be where most people eat as it's the most affordable, full of young tourists
- [Manda de Laos](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZgyoPoGQjrjF4LBk9) - the best restaurant I have found in Luang Prabang.
  Upmarket, expensive, but fantastic dining experience eating by a large internal lilly pond.
  This is the sort of luxury looking place you'd see on Love Island or something.
  Great menu, wifi only 15Mbit/s, but you probably shouldnt be working here.
  You will need to book a table here to be guaranteed entry. Fantastic tasting menu but \$84-\$105 per person net,
  which is outrageously expensive for Laos, I've never seen anything remotely this expensive here.
  Also, an additional 20% is added to total bill for VAT and service charge. The Mekong fish salad is mainly 2 pieces
  of fried fish with a small cucumber salad underneath them hidden by the fish pieces, good flavour.
  The orange juice was small for the price. This is an experience place, take your girlfriend here.
- [La Silapa Italian & Lao Kitchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qc6qeAQ3yk6uwid29) - upmarket italian wood-fired pizza,
  good shake, 45Mbit/s wifi
- [Sena Steak House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K4Nr2op8Ynts97Cz9) - open later than most places here until 11:30pm,
  kitchen closes at 11pm, 35Mbit wifi, mediocre bolognese, but good fresh orange juice, albeit expensive at \$3
- [Khmu Garden Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VRbNLSzJG3hc8uXo6) - interesting concept, 35Mbit wifi
- [88 Chophouse restaurant & bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XxoD8EQBo6xP9PGv6) - reasonable food and drink prices,
  but bolognese was too small for \$4.50, orange juice decent but modest size for \$2,
  fish & chips was a bit low brow for \$5, 75Mbit wifi
- [Redbul Sport bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uiS548cgZFJnwKJG6) - open until 11:30pm, 33Mbit download but only 4Mbit
  upload wifi, kitchen closes at 10pm, bar until 11:30pm
- [LPMC Bar & Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wpHhBUyiRmhgvdcX9) - quieter end of town but 160Mbit wifi
- [Outback Laos](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dhbzj7hNH1MojeFz5) - western bar, music too loud to work there
- [Chez Auguste - Café Crêperie](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2Hta8B5ypS9rk2sEA) - only 9Mbit wifi on porch
- [Best Cafe Luang Prabang](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3yvoiAKYLuWu7CL38) - 75Mbit wifi
- [Coffee Express](https://maps.app.goo.gl/q8FR8t8ZuP6nyAtp7) - nice venue, but only 10-15Mbit wifi, too slow for calls
