# Serbia

I used the [Airalo](https://www.airalo.com/) e-sim data only for $14 for 5GB valid for 30 days.

On subsequent visits I've used the [Nomad](https://www.getnomad.app/) e-sim
as it was cheaper - 1GB or 3GB for £3.38 or £6.76, respectively.

## Indoor Smoking, Outdoor Smoking, Smoking Everywhere in Serbia

It is still legal to smoke indoors in Serbia.

This really isn't the EU.

Unfortunately people seem to smoke a lot in Serbia.
I've changed tables while dinning outdoors at al fresco restaurants, only to have someone else then start smoking next
to me at another table.

I've moved indoor tables to escape from smokers,
and even cut short a coffee evening in frustration with people chain-smoking nearby due to getting fed up with all the
smoke inside the coffee shop.

You have to feel sorry for the Serbian wait staff subjected to second-hand smoke all day every day at work.

Quite shocking that Serbia permits this.

I've asked the locals about this and they said there are a couple non-smoking venues *"but nobody goes there"*.

## Taxis in Serbia

- [Car Go](https://appcargo.com/en) - like Uber. Usually the cheapest but wait times seem much longer than advertised, and sometimes it didn't
  find any drivers, so I had to use Yandex Go or Pink Taxi below instead
- [Yandex Go](https://go.yandex/) - a bit pricier than Car Go but seems to have more drivers
- [Pink Taxi](https://pinktaxi.info/) - has mixed reviews, but it worked
- Lux Taxi app couldn't even register using my UK mobile number - I got
  [this error](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/harisekhon_imagine-having-a-top-taxi-app-in-belgrade-activity-7242252581597585409-MRlJ) 🤪

## Driving in Serbia

It took over **3 hours** to get through the Hungarian - Serbian border.

I asked a guy in the queue of cars in front of me and he said 3-4 hours was common.

**IMPORTANT** - Make sure you have every document possible including your vehicle registration otherwise the Serbian police
will either refuse to let you in or blackmail you out money. Don't ask me how I know this.

See the [Driving Checklist](#driving-checklist) above.

I also saw several people pulled over by Serbian police.

Be wary of Serbian police. *"You are not in the EU now"* as they said to me.

Overall, a horrible experience driving to Serbia and I would not do it again.

You immediately feel like you've gone from Europe to some dangerous 3rd world country where you are more worried about
the police themselves and corruption.

My car also broke down - the battery was a right-off after leaving it in storage for 7 months.
Even buying an overpriced Noco boost charger for £150 (at 40% above UK price) and emptying its charge into it twice
didn't  work, and nor did jump cabling from a truck.

## Belgrade

### Buses in Belgrade & Nikola Tesla Airport

Buses became free in Belgrade in 2025!!!

Except for the A1 bus to / from the airport which costs 400 rsd (Serbian dinars)...
around €3.40 - but you don't need to take the A1 bus, you can take the 600 or 607 buses to / from Nikola Tesla airport.
As you come out of the airport arrivals lounge on the lower level (departures is upper level), the bus stop is literally
outside the door, even closer than the taxies across the street...

...and if you do want to take a taxi, remember to never take tourist trap taxis outside airports as they're usually
twice the price. See the [Taxis in Serbia](#taxis-in-serbia) section above for the taxi apps.

My travel buddy rode the buses all day around Belgrade when he discovered this and then took me to a bigger mall on the
outskirts.

### Hostels in Belgrade

I like:

- [Habitat Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sfZpNsEL7KoKLGtH7) - cheap £10 per night and they have a big dog
- [Nomad Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4J9Hbi1jKe44jE117) - cheap and central on
  [Skadarlija](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EmubAYnEWMkfSW1T7) which means it is noisy in the evenings until they close the
  windows, but has privacy curtains on the lower bunks and a good kitchen area

TODO:

- [Balkan Soul Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e5boYR2CavZtF5Bo7)
- [Good People Hostel ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/faWhbVnstLj3hWii6) - liked by my travel buddy and a girl I met
  travelling who stayed there
- [The Traveling Theater Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qo6NaCErN38HTY8K7)
- [Pop Art Rooms](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hUHokqpm8vAknrZh6) - a little more expensive but very stylist interior and
  near Belgrade Waterfront
- [Hostelche](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9Ez4iVwZdn8dZ1jD9)

**Not Recommended:**

- [Hidden Gem Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/52LY2TqBehMoLTmq6) - my travel buddy tried it, said it was too small and
  that he preferred Good People Hostel above

-->

### Restaurants in Belgrade

The capital is reasonable in the center. Overall it is slightly cheaper to dine than other European cities.

The top end of the range is typically comparable to other european cities.

The lower end is typically about half that.

- [Street Pasta Bar - Sremska](https://maps.app.goo.gl/woUhBnmt8973aEqH7) - is my top pick here - cheap, fresh juices,
  good wifi and young crowd (probably due to it being cheap).
  I've spent many hours on their wifi with regular top ups of juices and smoothies because they're so affordable,
  on top of lunch and dinner.
  Closes earlier than other restaurants at 9pm so it's better as a daytime place.
  Non-smoking, a rare find in Belgrade.
  There is a second one of these but it's not as good as it used to be because they moved and have a smaller venue with
  less good road window / lighting
- [Elephant's Food House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aK24TL7T6c3cm3xKA) - another good cheap lunch type place.
  Closes early at 6pm
- [Zendwich](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e4jXMpjC6Fqb2WFW9) - asian restaurant, good food and reasonable prices,
  a mix South Korean & Japanese cuisine styles.
  The flank steak ciabatta has good quality meat with kimchi and is only 1250rsd (€10.50)
- [PRANA Brunch & More](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1pJSNozw9625KRYA7) - all day brunch until 7-8pm the, with the usual
  gentrified type of brunch food - fresh juices and smoothies,
  variations of avocado toast, eggs on foccacia or sourdough toast, oatmeal / acai / granola bowls.
  The the juice was a decent size [for Europe!] for 420rsd (€3.50 - 2/3 the price of the tourist trap places in the
  centre), and the proscuitto & goats cheese on avocado spread toast, with roasted
  red pepper and toasted almonds were quite good, but then it should be for 940rsd (€8).
  Wifi 9/5 Mbit/s outside
- [Thyme - StreetCuisine & Cocktails](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DKEt6dwnfTToc9K17) - upmarket (pricey) top 25 restaurant
  in Belgrade, prime location on the side street just off the main high street, opposite the Rajićeva Shopping Center
  and next to the Kalemegdan park and Belgrade fortress.
  Expect to pay €20-30 per head + drinks.
  The truffle burger, called the "By chefs" burger, comes with caramelized onion, truffle butter slab, pecorino cheese
  (like parmesan) which is grated in front of you.
  I didn't notice any pistachios in it as per the menu though.
  The truffle burger is also quite a premium at 1700rsd (€15) for just the burger, 1.7x the price of the regular burger,
  and it's not very big, leaving space for dessert!
  The crispy fries were light and crispy, and heavily salted, which made them taste very good.
  The Tanasko steak main in the specials section was interesting, it appeared smaller than expected, but hit the spot
  with 4 good quality short thick slices of katsu-sando sirloin steak served medium-rare with each piece on its side,
  sandwiched with thin white bread and an orange sauce of homemade sriracha. It has a chilli symbol next to it but was
  not spicy.
  The accompanying sides also appeared small, with 3 glazed spring onions and 4 triple fried potato chunky fries -
  honestly it would have been better if they'd added more of these as they were very good to dunk in the orange sauce.
  The orange juice and mixed juice were good but unfortunately very small at 0.25l, seems more like 0.2l, tiny, not sure
  if worth it, or you'd have to order two of them.
  - Desserts - of the three desserts I've tried, this is the order in which I rank them:
    - The _"Juicy, Fruity, Exotic"_ dessert was a very good fine dessert, small but full of flavours - a lime cake with thin
  base, held in by a a white chocolate side, topped by 2 meringue bars and a small opal shaped multivitamin ice cream,
  and passionfruit and mint sauce.
    - The _"Creamy, Milky, Coconut"_ dessert is basically a rice pudding with caramel on top and coconut flakes -
  it's very good - eat it vertically for best results.
    - The poppy seed cake has a half cm thick layer of chocolate on top and a small vanilla ice cream scoop on it - this was
     my least favourite for the three desserts.
  Google Maps says the kitchen is open until 11pm but in reality only 10:45pm and by 10:40pm they would only serve a
  burger and not any of the specialities.
    - TODO: also try the ice cream with pistachio glaze and raspberry ice cream...
  Wifi 10/13 Mbit/s
  - [Thyme](https://thyme.rs/) has two other restaurants with even better menus but they are further out:
    - [Thyme - StreetFood & Breakfast, Karađorđeva](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Es1kENwE6dW3zFy97)
    - [Thyme - StreetFood & Breakfast, Kirovljeva](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6gup2bvsC4w8zUdR8)
- [Kafeterija Magazin 1907](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PwaZbmMLMU7zTr1Z6) - good coffee shop with 2 levels right in the
  centre, often busy and open late until 11pm - the have extensive menus of drinks,
  including fresh pressed juices and smoothies including acai,
  protein etc, as well as acai / moat / chia bowls, all day eggs breakfasts, as well as burgers, sandwiches, wraps and
  salads.
  The acai smoothie was 600rsd (€5) but was a good size,
  much bigger than the 350ml compared other venues ml sizes like Thyme.
  Kitchen closes just before 10pm.
  TODO: try the Acai and other bowls
  Wifi is capture portal with 5/5 Mbit/s speed
- [Перло бургери (Perlo's Burger)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/etkwZ4JAMwTLbLhh7) - highly rated gentrified small burger
  restaurant facing Republic Square.
  I can't believe it took my 4th trip to Belgrade to find this place which has a 4.9 Google rating!
  The signature Perlo burger is not big, but good quality with truffle aoli sauce.
  The fries with spice dusting aren't a big portion either, the spice is a 5 mix and not spicy, more like orange salt.
  They don't have cutlery so be prepared to get your hands dirty in true fast food fashion.
  This is probably the best fast food you'll have in Belgrade.
  Wifi is only 0.5/0.5 Mbit/s
- [Bege Sendviči](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CTzVcJZg3QVDFM369) - cheap late night good quality, choose 4 meats in a
  sandwich and have it toasted for only 390rsd (€3) - hard to beat this. Good stop for protein after going to Street Gym
- [Brusnica](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BokB17u66mckEd8DA) - relatively expensive health food restaurant in buzzing evening
  location on the Obilićev venac bar strip just off Republic Square in the center - you're paying for the location.
  It has with fresh juices, acai bowls, eggs breakfasts, avocado toast, chia and oats, fruits, salads with
  protein add-ons like chicken, salmon, bacon, nuts, seeds etc. as well as cheesecake desserts and cocktails.
  A bit pricier for fresh squeezed juices than say Street Pasta Bar, but open later as they didn't do me a juice at 8pm.
  The tropical acai bowl is not what one would expect,
  it's more like a dessert with chocolate and many other things in it -
  this is a sugar treat even more than a regular acai bowl.
  This place refuses to split group bills so you might want to bring cash if in a group.
  Wifi 10/7 Mbit/s
- [Boutique #1](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mxsz6q5hFQfJEDhj8) - prime location restaurant overlooking Republic Square -
  good for drinks but also has food and a good looking dessert menu.
  Unfortunately it's a bit expensive at €5-6 for a juice.
  Wifi 15/0.5 Mbit/s outside
- [Boutique #2](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1svhc4v3bq3aAwfh7) - prime location sister restaurant to Boutique 1 on the main
  high street at the Belgrade Fortress end for drinks or food on the main parade, very popular and good menu.
  Open late until 12-1am this is one of the latest places open on the main high street
- [Trattoria Pepe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gdP9dLWxAVzGYEdV6) - excellent Italian 5 minutes walk from the centre - worth the walk
- [Kafana Suvobor](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PqQ4iuStYhSz1EnGA) - good Serbian restaurant in the district the locals eat,
  5 minutes walk off the main high street.
  The bread came warm and combined with the ajvar red pepper dip starter was decent.
  The peppers in oil was a different flavour and also worth trying, 3 large red peppers with garlic.
  From the barbequeue menu we had skipped the cevapi as it's just minced meat which is lower quality meat,
  and went with the solid meat pork skewers instead, which came with 2 skewers.
  However, my favourite pick at this restaurant is the veal sausages, and I don't normally rate sausages but these were
  full of flavour, I would go back just for these.
  The Baklava dessert was decent, better than the "venison" chocolate cake, the latter of which I would skip next time
- [Hotel Moskva](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UBCTFmgQWfztRtESA) - fresh juices, fine desserts, go for an afternoon drink /
  dessert
- [Orasac (Орашац)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/D9ok9vaHDVjJceWp7) - the "karadordeva snicla" pork wrapped around cheese and
  coated in breadcrumbs was the best thing we had by far.
  The beef goulash with mashed potato, and other pork dish we had was reasonable too.
  They also have fresh squeezed orange juice.
  Kitchen closes at 10:30pm
- [Curry Souls in Galerija Male](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YRvKTri4nMXrpHs98) - outdoor terrace seating oversees the
  Belgrade Waterfront - the chicken thigh curry was good,
  as was the side cucumber and pineapple salad side add-on (although it is small).
  Wifi 6/25 Mbit/s outdoors on terrace
  - [Curry Souls in Obilićev venac](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jEzrzNh75eYhzYdG8) - is just off the main high street and
    has good outdoor seating for summer, with the same menu
- [Oskar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xtbibPCagq1qP5jCA) - good quality restaurant, a few minutes off the beaten track
  (usually better finds because they survive on foot and not tourist trap). 43/31 Mbit/s wifi
- [Burger House Bros Centar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C5FyhgFp16gPN11H9) - very good burger restaurant
- [Casa Nova](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mPPNKEYf2M5FKnm49) - has both outdoor and a non-smoking section on the upper level
  rear section (quiet section, everybody in Belgrade seems to smoke)
- [Velika Skadarlija](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jHfCipxrNiK4Bzg66) - good restaurant with great outdoor seating area, with
  the odd plug if you need it
- [Restoran Kosmaj](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9QK4fMvPjWVTVyZW7) - on the main road, but the food was good
  eg. beef goulash with mash was decent, less salty than Oskar but a bit more fat on the beef. 12/2 Mbit/s wifi
- [Burgos - Premium Burger Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PHEvHFbcsdyYANvb7) - good quality but burger bar.
  “Serbian gourmet” burger came stacked 4inches tall for 840rsd (€7), and the fries were skinny but hot and fresh for
  240rsd (€2). The sweet potato fries were also good for 320rsd (€2.70). The dips are charged but good sized portions,
  I had the honey-mustard and chipotle-mayo which were both very good, I polished them off and every bite of all the
  food. Wifi 7/6 Mbit/s
- [Smash Burgers](https://maps.app.goo.gl/38WxX9dnwcSn67Pq7) - fast food, for £7.50 for a burger and fries without a
  drink, should perhaps have got a proper restaurant meal for £9 instead.
  The burger was very fast food, fries were mediocre,
  but the Habanero SOS sauce for dipping the fries was amazing (of course it was, it contains sugar),
  although getting the staff to give me a dish to put the sauce in was a challenge.
  The wifi worked at the bar but not at the main seating bench so no speed test here
- [URA! Russian dumplings](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tbNvia8txHUUNqim6) - best Russian dumplings in Belgrade apparently
- [Obilićev venac road](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kLPuPNVYTPoscB3v6) - tourist trap road full of restaurants just off the
  main square, trade prices for buzziness
  - [Hari's Creperie](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jph8LKEq9Cv8HkpTA) - sweet & savory crepes, pizza, salads, all day
    breakfast menu even including full english breakfast.
    The Hari's Special salad is an interesting mix of salad and fruit,
    but has perhaps too many raisins, so not died food.
    Decent but pricey due to the location. Only 5/1 Mbit/s wifi
  - [Choco Caffe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V5uHT5oQBejE7Y4c8) - on tourist trap street but decent, there is live music
    across the road which is plenty loud enough while sitting outside
  - [Stamevski](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jQYhSot45w6J3rTa8) - dessert restaurant with amazing looking cakes, has pistachio
    milkshake, although very fattening version. Wifi was slow as hell at 0.3/0.05 Mbit/s
- [Franš](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2Nw5ZndZ5h1Z8JGS8) - popular upmarket restaurant - if you want to know where rich
  people come to eat, it’s here.
  It has nice outdoor sheltered seating, good for summer.
  The food is reasonably decent, but not the best, and it's quite expensive.
  The cars parked in front were alternating Mercedes and Range Rovers, maybe the odd custom matt BMW SUV.
  I was surprised how busy it was on a Tuesday afternoon, and many women put on dresses to dine here, even on a Tuesday
  afternoon. These seem like the landlord class families who don't work.
  The smoked klobasa (sausages) were good,
  and if in doubt you can order the Homemade Frans Platter which is 6 different meats with a side of french fries
  (I swapped mine for roasted sliced potatoes).
  The perch fillets of fish is recommended from the seafood section.
  The sour cherry pie and ice cream in melon desserts were nothing special and I would skip them next time.
  18/15 Mbit/s wifi
- [Protein Global 1](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hXKbairSDSifnXmB9) - good menu, juices, smoothies,
  protein shakes, eggs breakfasts (until 2pm), protein oatmeal, burgers, pasta, steaks, salads, these guys have it all.
  On a side street but people still find it.
  The Ranch Eggs with turkey is like scrambled egg whites with turkey pieces, red bell pepper, tomato and spring onion,
  not the most exciting dish, but healthy and proteiny.
  I didn't like the protein pancakes though,
  they compromised far too much on flavour to try to keep them protein healthy,
  not worth it, and were quite difficult to get through.
  When you fancy pancakes, this is not what you expect -
  get normal pancakes at a normal place, you can't have everything at the same time.
  The detox smoothie was a bit more bitter than expected,
  but the 3 mixed juice (I chose orange, apple and pineapple) was nice and sweet and for 440rsd (€3.75) 300ml unlike
  other european places giving only 200ml.
  Wifi 148/23 Mbit/s.
  [Protein Global 2](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BiMRhL4MFio9dCqk6) is further out
- [Fit Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/S6nsPw9Ckj9v34Jg8) - small healthy eat place, chocolate protein porridge is good on
    the breakfast menu but the Energizer shake is my favourite here that keeps me coming back. One of the rare no smoking
    places in Belgrade. There are a couple of popular bars next door to here too.
    Don't get the protein shake to take away though,
    their takeaway cups are small 0.3l instead of the 0.4l glasses when you have it locally.
    Both local and takeaway juice portions are smaller
    than they used to be in 2024 as they now come in pre-pressed tiny bottles of 290ml,
    even smaller than quoted on the menu.
    I don't come here as much as I used to as a result now.

- [Ćevap kod Dekija](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9tzTUWr9Pc6UvsiS9) - overrated. The spicy sausages were mostly fatty bits,
  the minced meat cevap rolls were squishy and the bunless Serbian burger was the least bad part with some onions mixed
  in. Should have gone to Burger House Bros instead and gotten a proper meat burger.
  This was so bad I left a lot of the sausages and the cevap, and went to FitBar for a protein shake instead.

## Novi Sad

Good central district of restaurants.

Cheaper Airbnbs as 1.5 hour drive from Belgrade.

## Nis

Southern city on the way from Belgrade to Sofia, Bulgaria.

- [Distrikt cafe&bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DvvaWn7zjj2PTtp66) - nice decor, good selection of drinks, fresh juices,
  breakfasts, oatmeal special, burgers, pizza, pasta, mains, desserts.
  The chocolate cherry protein oatmeal was decent, but very calorie rich so I didn't finish it.
  The "lime time" juice mix containing lime, orange, apple, pineapple juice was good and freshly made
- [Kod Rajka](https://maps.app.goo.gl/U3grzPEDWyktKjNW8) - good serbian restaurant. The chicken in mushroom sauce is big
  and all chicken. The sopska salad (tomato, cucumber and onion, covered in shredded feta, is very good). The orange
