## Summary

Excellent music streaming platform with ultra low latency instant playing and offline downloads on Premium.

I've been using this platform and writing API code for it for about 15+ years.

There are a couple main weaknesses to this platform:

- Some tracks aren't available due to licensing, leaving you to source and load them yourself into the app,
  although this is rare
- Spotify API is not quite complete (misses folder structure)
- Spotify itself does not respond to community improvement requests and there have been improvement requests open for
  years for some things

Overall this is still my favourite music platform for the last 15+ years.

## Spotify API

The API is fairly good and exposes a lot of information, although not folder structure.

My extensive Spotify API code is available for free publicly (listed further down) to back up and manage playlists,
deduplicate, blacklist tracks and more.

My extensive Spotify playlists and filtering through tens of thousands of songs would not be sustainable without this
management code.

## Spotify API Code

Spotify scripts and API tools can be found in the following repos.

Extensive API code can be found in here:

Some generalization such as a Spotify command line and track name normalization rules can be found here:
