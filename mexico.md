## Airline Check-in & Immigration Control

**WARNING**: the airline refused to check me in without proof of an outbound flight, I had to quickly find and book
something out of Mexico just to check in with 10 minutes left until check-in closure since the check-in closes 1.5 hours
before the flight.

The immigration officer didn't ask for this - the insistant woman at Madrid airport preventing me from speaking to the
check-in desk was either just trying to ruin my day or it's the airlines policy, but it was not the immigration officer.

## Mexico City

The capital, reputation for being high crime.

## Yucatan Peninsula

### Cancun

Holiday city on the east coast, famous destination for US spring break students.

#### Cancun ATMs

The Santander ATM in the ADO bus station charged 35 pesos (€1.60) commission when withdrawing 2500 pesos, which was
reasonable compared to ATMs in other countries.

#### Cancun Restaurants

- [Carbon Tacos y Miches](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RTvATSPxnvr7UY9C8) - amazing strip steak burrito for 150 pesos (€7)
  and amazing sauces to add to it and plenty of limes.
  My first taste of Cancun & Mexico did not disappoint - this burrito and sauces blows Madrid's TKO Tacos out of the
  water.
  Skip the tacos though, even though they come doubled up, they fall apart quickly.
  Also avoid the chicken pieces are mediocre and too salty while the pork chop is ~50% fat and too salty. The "pastor"
  is likely even worse since it's shawarma meat on a spit like in a kebab shop.
  The strip steak is the thing to have here, nice and lean.

#### Travel from Cancun Airport

There is a red bus stand call ADO Aeropuerto, which if you exit Terminal 3 is on the right.
Google Maps tried to send me the wrong way, possibly to Terminal 2's ADO.

The ticket to Cancun costs 145 mexican pesos (£6), 170 pesos (£7) if you're travelling to the hotel zone.

I'm actually surprised it costs this much compared to even places in Europe I can travel to/from the airport for less.

I'm told taxis cost $30, so if there are 2-3 of you it's probably better to just take a taxi (try to fix the price up
front if you can to avoid surprises).

### Chichén Itzá

[Chichén Itzá](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XyRwnT7SHYCckcLx8) is the archaelogical ruins of a large Maya city with an iconic
step pyramid.

### Tulum

Coastal town with a ruins of a Mayan port city.
