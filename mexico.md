I'm actually shocked what a 3rd world country Mexico is walking around Cancun.

I had expected it to be more touristy and fancy,
the tourists must be hiding in the resorts
but walking around the regular streets in search of restaurants is jarring compared to coming from a 1st world city like
Madrid on my prior stop.

## Airline Check-in & Immigration Control

**WARNING**: the airline refused to check me in without proof of an outbound flight, I had to quickly find and book
something out of Mexico just to check in with 10 minutes left until check-in closure since the check-in closes 1.5 hours
before the flight.

The immigration officer didn't ask for this - the insistant woman at Madrid airport preventing me from speaking to the
check-in desk was either just trying to ruin my day or it's the airlines policy, but it was not the immigration officer.

## Mexico City

The capital, reputation for being high crime.

## Yucatan Peninsula

### Cancun

Holiday city on the east coast, famous destination for US spring break students.

#### Travel from Cancun Airport

There is a red bus stand call ADO Aeropuerto, which if you exit Terminal 3 is on the right.
Google Maps tried to send me the wrong way, possibly to Terminal 2's ADO.

The ticket to Cancun costs 145 mexican pesos (£6), 170 pesos (£7) if you're travelling to the hotel zone.

I'm actually surprised it costs this much compared to even places in Europe I can travel to/from the airport for less.

I'm told taxis cost $30, so if there are 2-3 of you it's probably better to just take a taxi (try to fix the price up
front if you can to avoid surprises).

#### Taxi Apps in Cancun

- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/en-mx) - bid your price, similar price to Uber, but the real saving is taking a
  motorbike ride which is half the price
- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/)

#### Cancun ATMs

The Santander ATM in the ADO bus station charged 35 pesos (€1.60) commission when withdrawing 2500 pesos, which was
reasonable compared to ATMs in other countries.

#### Cancun Restaurants

- [Carbon Tacos y Miches](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RTvATSPxnvr7UY9C8) - amazing strip steak burrito for 150 pesos (€7)
  and amazing sauces to add to it and plenty of limes.
  My first taste of Cancun & Mexico did not disappoint - this burrito and sauces blows Madrid's TKO Tacos out of the
  water.
  Skip the tacos though, even though they come doubled up, they are less tasty whole wheat tacos and they fall apart
  quickly regardless.
  Also avoid the chicken pieces are mediocre and too salty while the pork chop is ~50% fat and too salty. The _"pastor"_
  is likely even worse since it's shawarma meat on a spit like in a kebab shop.
  The strip steak is the thing to have here, nice and lean.
  The _"jamaica water"_ is a nice sweet hibiscus still drink served in a big fancy cocktail glass.
  Wifi 120/177 Mbit/s
- [Las Tostadillas Del Mar Ruta Nader](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BPMpj6nBKyU9Q8438) - seafood restaurant with reasonable
  prices for tacos and tostas.
  Could do with a better drinks menu, and didn't get the wifi working due to capture portal.
  Skip the tacos and go straight for the tostas next time.
  The tacos are cheap, but like at Carbon, are whole wheat, not so tasty and the ingredients were not properly handled.
  The fried shrimp was massive dough balls on a modest prawn,
  the white fish was a bit better but still way too much batter,
  and the octopus came burnt to a crisp due to all the small pieces of it.
  The mixed seafood toasta on the other hand came nice and crunchy base with excellent ingredient topping,
  shrimp and thicker octopus tentacle pieces, with lots of tomato making it like a mexican bruschetta.
  I would just get two or three of these next time.
  Because the tacos were a bit of a disaster I forgot to even try the 4 sauces.
  I also had to ask for limes,
  there is a small self-service area for this opposite the bar but you'll need a small plate from the staff.
