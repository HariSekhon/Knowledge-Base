## Airline Check-in & Immigration Control

**WARNING**: the airline refused to check me in without proof of an outbound flight, I had to quickly find and book
something out of Mexico just to check in with 10 minutes left until check-in closure since the check-in closes 1.5 hours
before the flight.

The immigration officer didn't ask for this - the insistant woman at Madrid airport preventing me from speaking to the
check-in desk was either just trying to ruin my day or it's the airlines policy, but it was not the immigration officer.

## Mexico City

The capital, reputation for being high crime.

## Yucatan Peninsula

### Cancun

Holiday city on the east coast, famous destination for US spring break students.

Cancun is a tale of two cities:

- the _"Hotel Zone"_ is what you'd imagine, touristy, Americanized, full of huge resorts, where people go to party in
  nightclubs etc.
- El Centro - the centre / downtown - where the local mexican service staff actually live, a ghetto

I'm actually shocked what a 3rd world country Mexico is walking around Cancun central.

I had expected it to be more touristy and fancy,
the tourists must be hiding in the resorts
but walking around the regular streets in search of restaurants is jarring compared to coming from a 1st world city like
Madrid on my prior stop.

#### Travel from Cancun Airport

There is a red bus stand call ADO Aeropuerto, which if you exit Terminal 3 is on the right.
Google Maps tried to send me the wrong way, possibly to Terminal 2's ADO.

The ticket to Cancun costs 145 mexican pesos (£6), 170 pesos (£7) if you're travelling to the hotel zone.

I'm actually surprised it costs this much compared to even places in Europe I can travel to/from the airport for less.

I was told taxis cost around \$30, but actually when I checked it was \$20 on Uber and \$13 on InDrive, so if there are
2-3 of you it's probably better to just take an Uber or InDrive anyway.
Needless to say, don't try to take as a gringo without fixing the price up front.

#### Taxi Apps in Cancun

- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/en-mx) - bid your price, similar price to Uber, but the real saving is taking a
  motorbike ride which is half the price
- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/)

#### Cancun ATMs

The Santander ATM in the ADO bus station charged 35 pesos (€1.60) commission when withdrawing 2500 pesos, which was
reasonable compared to ATMs in other countries.

Skip:

- [Playa Tortugas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HWdTCSAGZWtPtoebA) - Turtle Beach - it's a small beach with just locals and
  only one low rated restaurant.
  There were no turtles, only Mexicans.
  Google Maps even has a [phantom incorrect location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1LWXrMALStsKF9N47) for it,
  wasting your time and taxi fares

#### Cancun Restaurants

- [Carbon Tacos y Miches](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RTvATSPxnvr7UY9C8) - amazing strip steak burrito for 150 pesos (€7)
  and amazing sauces to add to it and plenty of limes.
  My first taste of Cancun & Mexico did not disappoint - this burrito and sauces blows Madrid's TKO Tacos out of the
  water.
  The strip steak burrito is the thing to have here, nice and lean.
  It comes with a condiment caddy with the following: a pot full of limes, lemon guacamole (mild), but the real stars
  are the chills; chile de pasilla (medium spicy, light red brown, my favourite), chile de habanero (spicy, green),
  chile de arbol (spiciest, dark red-brown).
  I love to cut up a piece of burrito, drench it in lime and then pile on one of the chilli toppings - my favourite
  thing to eat in Mexico so far, I had to return to do this again!
  The _"jamaica water"_ is a nice sweet hibiscus still drink served in a big fancy cocktail glass.
  Alternatively, the Guava water drink is nice too.
  You will need occasional sips of a drink if you are stacking the chillis like me,
  and also the paper napkins for the inevitable running nose from chilli!
  Skip the tacos though, even though they come doubled up, they are less tasty whole wheat tacos and they fall apart
  quickly regardless.
  Also avoid the chicken pieces - they're mediocre and too salty, while the pork chop is ~50% fat and too salty.
  The _"pastor"_ is probably even worse since it's just shawarma meat from the rotating spit like in a kebab shop.
  The cheesecake is the only dessert on the menu but it's mediocre, for 158 pesos ($8.60) I'd skip this next time as
  it's not worth the price or the calories. Stay shredded.
  Wifi 120/177 Mbit/s
- [Las Tostadillas Del Mar Ruta Nader](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BPMpj6nBKyU9Q8438) - seafood restaurant with reasonable
  prices for tacos and tostas.
  Could do with a better drinks menu, and didn't get the wifi working due to capture portal.
  Skip the tacos and go straight for the tostas next time.
  The tacos are cheap, but like at Carbon, are whole wheat, not so tasty and the ingredients were not properly handled.
  The fried shrimp was massive dough balls on a modest prawn,
  the white fish was a bit better but still way too much batter,
  and the octopus came burnt to a crisp due to all the small pieces of it.
  The mixed seafood toasta on the other hand came nice and crunchy base with excellent ingredient topping,
  shrimp and thicker octopus tentacle pieces, with lots of tomato making it like a mexican bruschetta.
  I would just get two or three of these next time.
  Because the tacos were a bit of a disaster I forgot to even try the 4 sauces.
  I also had to ask for limes,
  there is a small self-service area for this opposite the bar but you'll need a small plate from the staff.
