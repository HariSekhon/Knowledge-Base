## Airline Check-in & Immigration Control

**WARNING**: the airline refused to check me in without proof of an outbound flight, I had to quickly find and book
something out of Mexico just to check in with 10 minutes left until check-in closure since the check-in closes 1.5 hours
before the flight.

The immigration officer didn't ask for this - the insistant woman at Madrid airport preventing me from speaking to the
check-in desk was either just trying to ruin my day or it's the airlines policy, but it was not the immigration officer.

## Mexico City

The capital, reputation for being high crime.

## Yucatan Peninsula

### Cancun

Holiday city on the east coast, famous destination for US spring break students.

#### Travel from Cancun Airport

There is a red bus stand call ADO Aeropuerto as you exit the airport on the right.
Do not follow Google Maps it'll send you the wrong way.

The ticket to Cancun costs 145 mexican pesos (£6), 170 pesos (£7) if you're travelling to the hotel zone.

I'm actually surprised it costs this much compared to even places in Europe I can travel to/from the airport for less.

I'm told taxis cost $30.

### Chichén Itzá

[Chichén Itzá](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XyRwnT7SHYCckcLx8) is the archaelogical ruins of a large Maya city with an iconic
step pyramid.

### Tulum

Coastal town with a ruins of a Mayan port city.
