## Airline Check-in & Immigration Control

**WARNING**: the airline refused to check me in without proof of an outbound flight, I had to quickly find and book
something out of Mexico just to check in with 10 minutes left until check-in closure since the check-in closes 1.5 hours
before the flight.

The immigration officer didn't ask for this - the insistant woman at Madrid airport preventing me from speaking to the
check-in desk was either just trying to ruin my day or it's the airlines policy, but it was not the immigration officer.

## Spanish Crash Course

Most people speak little to no English, surprising for a place that receives so much English-speaking tourism.

It greatly helps to know a bit of Spanish to get by, as you will struggle if relying on Google Translate for every
little thing.

| English                   | Spanish   |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| Yes                       | Si        |
| No                        | No        |
| Please                    | Por favor |
| Thank You                 | Gracias   |
| Fish                      | Pescado   |
| Shrimp                    | Cameron   |
| Skirt Steak / Flank Steak | Arrachera |
| Beach                     | Playa     |
| Very Good                 | Muy Bueno |

## Mexican Food

It can be quite confusing with many similar names, so here is a few quick tips:

| Food              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aguachile         | Raw meat or seafood in a zesty lime-chilli-cilantro sauce, served with nachos or plain untopped tostas / tostadas for you to load it up on to - this is one of my new favourite dishes, although quite extreme by western standards in both lime and chilli, start with the mildest one! |
| Tacos             | Small soft round tortillas - these are actually overrated, I prefer aguachile and tostas                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Tostas / Tostadas | Toasted flat tacos topped with meat/seafood and chopped tomato like bruschetta                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Tortas            | Sandwich - not to be confused with Tostas!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Volcane           | Toasted crispy tortilla base (aka tosta aka tostada) with melted cheese on it and topped with meat. Named because the cheese is like a volcano                                                                                                                                           |
| Tlayuda           | Large tortilla with re-fied beans base and ingredients, folded and toasted until the cheese is melted                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Tamale            | Filling wrapped and cooked in a corn husk or banana leaf - you eat the filling and discard the leaf                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Mexico City

The capital, reputation for being high crime.

## Oaxaca City

Oaxaca (Wahaca) has has a lot of restaurants and quite a few churches with nice architectural facades.

You can walk around the centre in around 2 hours,
so you'll need 2-3 days depending on whether you want to go hiking for a day or not.

The restaurants are tourist priced though,
typically 2-3x the price of locally priced restaurants in Cancun El Centro,
more like the tourist trap hotel zone in Cancun.

The taxi apps also don't work, they don't find drivers.

Overall I don't want to spend too much time in Oaxaca.

### Oaxaca Airport

Airport wifi requires a capture portal in Spanish.

The fields are; First Name, Last Name, Mother's Maiden Name (optional), Email address, Phone number (with +xx
international prefix).

This worked better than the similar capture portal in Cancun.

Remwmber to download an offline Google Map while on wifi.

#### Travel from Oaxaca Airport to Oaxaca

You can get a taxi in the terminal, but theh are quite expensive, quoting over 400 peses for a mere 7km.

InDrive has taxis for 180 pesos, but it didn't find a driver.

Or you can buy a shared transport at the taxi stand in the terminal for 135 pesos, for a small minibus, but they make
take a long time to leave as they wait for other passengers.

I took a punt on the latter just to see what it's like. When arriving if not in a rush this is a good time to experiment
and learn.

#### Taxis in Oaxaca

Both taxi apps failed to find me a driver from the airport, and also from the centre to Mount Alban.

You can see in InDrive only 2-4 drivers even saw the request, which is very low compared to other cities where it's more like 7+.

#### Restaurants in Oaxaca

Most restaurants I've seen in Oaxaca are tourist priced.

- [Humar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HtHJ3icQ7uVFJ3Yk8) - seafood restaurant with good menu and moderate prices.
  The best aguachile verde I've had so far in Mexico, with large jumbo shrimps and topped with half a sliced avocado.
  The octopus taco was interesting with a bean paste base and crackers in it.
  The felix passionfruit drink is good, slightly sparking and not too sweet, served in a whisky glass with a giant ice cube.
  The horchata is not in the menu, but is surprisingly good, not too sweet like some other places.
  It's served in a large tall whisky glass, and contains small melon cubes and quite a lot of small pieces of walnuts.
- [La Casa del Tío Güero](https://maps.app.goo.gl/w2xigghHgMoUeQk8A) - the mole negro (black mole) with pork was really
  good and came with 2 large lean squares of pork, sides of rice, tortilla and chilli sauce. The mole itself was
  slightly sweet (it contains chocolate) so add the right amount of chilli sauce to suit your tastes
- [Humito Cocina y Foro 8 Temblor](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oNbAwiHswxbTYnSA9) - good quality and taste, would probably
  be rated higher than 4.5 if it wasn't Western priced.
  The Carnito Mixteco main was good, a mole containing shredded chicken pieces with sweet potato and white rice, a
  moderate sized portion.
  Their black mole with pork was 400 pesos which seems overpriced considering I had one the night before for 185 in the
  centre at La Casa del Tio Guero above, which wins on food vs price.
  Their ceviche (catch of the day) and passion fruit tostada was a medley of flavours and so loaded up you couldn't eat
  it without it falling apart.
  This was trying to be the michelin of tostadas on a crispy black tostada and too many ingredients and flavours,
  real overkill.
  At 150 pesos for a single tostada I doubt any average local would ever pay this consider I was getting seafood
  tostadas for 25-30 pesos in Cancun El Centro.
  I would skip this overly fancy tostada next time and just stick with the mole.
  The water of the day (mango) was very good, just the right about of sweetness and liquidity (70 pesos / £3).
  I dropped 500 pesos here, whereas elsewhere I was eating well for 150-300 pesos.
  Wifi 246/286 Mbit/s
- [Totopo Güero Cocina Istmeña](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dar1gyFggLKPsr2a7) - highly rated, upstairs off the street.
  Interesting menu, not as expensive as many other places in Oaxaca.
  The bean soup was quite decent, although the bean is the base of the soup, not a soup containing beans as a westerner
  might expect.
  The beef stew was too sweet for my liking, I would try something else next time.
  The passion fruit water was good.
  Wifi 98/104 Mbit/s

## Yucatan Peninsula

### Cancun

Holiday city on the east coast, famous destination for US spring break students.

Cancun is a tale of two cities:

- the _"Hotel Zone"_ is what you'd imagine, touristy, Americanized, full of huge resorts, where people go to party in
  nightclubs etc.
- El Centro - the centre / downtown - where the local mexican service staff actually live, a ghetto

In this sense, Cancun is a lot of what is wrong with the world - the K shaped economy that caters mostly to the rich
while leaving everyone else's standard of living in the dirt.

Still, if you want to live like a rich person for a week or two before you go back to your tax slave democracy job, stay
in a resort in the hotel zone.

I'm actually shocked what a 3rd world country Mexico is walking around Cancun central.

I had expected it to be more touristy and fancy, the tourists must be hiding in the resorts but walking around the
regular streets in search of restaurants is jarring compared to coming from a 1st world city like Madrid on my prior
stop.

#### Cancun Airport

##### Cancun Airport Wifi

Cancun Airport Wifi is not good, dont rely on it, set up your esim before you arrive.

##### Travel from Cancun Airport

There is a red bus stand call ADO Aeropuerto, which if you exit Terminal 3 is on the right.
Google Maps tried to send me the wrong way, possibly to Terminal 2's ADO.

The ticket to Cancun costs 145 mexican pesos (£6), 170 pesos (£7) if you're travelling to the hotel zone.

I'm actually surprised it costs this much compared to even places in Europe I can travel to/from the airport for less.

I was told taxis cost around \$30, but actually when I checked it was \$20 on Uber and \$13 on InDrive, so if there are
2-3 of you it's probably better to just take an Uber or InDrive anyway.
Needless to say, don't try to take as a gringo without fixing the price up front.

I took a taxi on the way to the airport just for better timing control, see the Taxi Apps section further down.

#### Travel within Cancun

Even if you stay within the Hotel Zone, its still quite a long walk up and down, several kilometers.

If you decide to visit El Centro or save money by staying in a hostel in El Centro, you can forget about walking
everywhere as it'll destroy your knees trying.

You will at some point need to either take taxis (see the section below) or learn to use the local buses.

#### Buses in Cancun

Buses are cheap (12 pesos) and there are lots of them as the locals use them extensively.

Taxis while not expensive by international standards are multiple times the cost of a bus.

If you want to live like a local for a more authentic experience, or are travelling on a budget, take the bus.

Unfortunately, Google Maps is absolutely useless as of late 2025 and has absolutely no section on public transport.

To make matter worse, the bus stops are often not well designated, sometimes just a bench at the side of the road
without signage.

There are no timetables with bus numbers as you may be used to in 1st world countries.

Interestingly though, you can ask ChatGPT and it will tell you the bus numbers you need and roughly where to catch them
down to the road (you need to figure out the direction you need to travel by looking at Google Maps).

#### Taxi Apps in Cancun

Sometimes the prices are comparable between Uber and InDrive but other times they are not, check both.

Uber quoted me 350-370 pesos to Cancun airport but InDrive took me for 160 pesos. This is a very good price considering
the ADO bus was 128 pesos per person, so if there are two or more of you this taxi actually works out cheaper!

I'd guess that Western people sticking to Uber drove the prices right up during checkout time, they hadn't thought to
spread the load to InDrive so I saved more than half the cost!

- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/en-mx) - bid your price, motorbike ride is half the price of a car ride but there were no takers. You will
  often get drivers sending you higher offers, ignore them, usually one takes your app recommended offer price
- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/)

#### ATMs in Cancun

The Santander ATM in the ADO bus station charged 35 pesos (€1.60) commission when withdrawing 2500 pesos, which was
reasonable compared to ATMs in other countries.

Banregio atm was charging 84 pesos, do not use that one.

Bancoppel fee was 36 pesos.

#### Attractions in Cancun

I'll inevitably miss some as there are so many...

- [Tulum](#tulum) - day trip to Tulum, see section below

  they will be on you the second you stop to take a picture
  - [Playa del Niño](https://maps.app.goo.gl/btEhugKHpepQjsv39) - beach strip near Zona Arqueológica de El Meco

- [Plaza Las Americas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5Fe2WG1SAqkasVLd7) - south of El Centro / downtown - American brands
  mall with American chain restaurants, and a food court.
  You probably don't want to eat here if you have much in the way of standards and care about your figure.
  - [Súper Naturista](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aZZynwA1K8dckF9aA) - expensive but good selection of vitamins, supplements

  only one low rated restaurant.
  There were no turtles, only Mexicans.
  Google Maps even has a [phantom incorrect location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1LWXrMALStsKF9N47) for it,
  wasting your time and taxi fares

#### Restaurants in Cancun

- [Carbon Tacos y Miches](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RTvATSPxnvr7UY9C8) - amazing strip steak burrito for 150 pesos (€7)
  and the most amazing chilli salsas I ever recall having to add to it, as well as plenty of limes.
  My first taste of Cancun & Mexico did not disappoint - this burrito and sauces blows Madrid's TKO Tacos out of the
  water.
  The strip steak burrito is the thing to have here, nice and lean.
  The strip steak taco and volcane are good too.
  All come with a condiment caddy with the following: a pot full of limes, lemon guacamole (mild), but the real stars
  are the chill salsas; chile de pasilla (medium spicy, light red brown, my favourite), chile de habanero
  (spicy, green), chile de arbol (spiciest, dark red-brown).
  I love to cut up a piece of burrito, drench it in lime and then pile on one of the chilli toppings - my favourite
  thing to eat in Mexico so far, I was eating here every 2 days afte this.
  The strip steak torta sandwich is decent quality but a bit small for the price compared to the adjacent offerings.
  The _"jamaica water"_ is a nice sweet hibiscus still drink served in a big fancy cocktail glass.
  The horchata is one of the better quality ones I've had with a full cinnamon twig in it, although a bit sweet.
  Alternatively, the Guava water drink is nice too.
  You will need occasional sips of a drink if you are stacking the chillis like me,
  and also the paper napkins for the inevitable running nose from chilli!
  Skip the tacos though, even though they come doubled up, they are less tasty whole wheat tacos and they fall apart
  quickly regardless.
  Also avoid the chicken pieces - they're mediocre and too salty, while the pork chop is ~50% fat and too salty.
  The _"pastor"_ is probably even worse since it's just shawarma meat from the rotating spit like in a kebab shop.
  The cheesecake is the only dessert on the menu but it's mediocre, for 158 pesos ($8.60) I'd skip this next time as
  it's not worth the price or the calories. Stay shredded.
  Their card machine always times out on apple pay touch (despite them having fast wifi) and I had to use my physical
  card with pin.
  Wifi 120/177 Mbit/s
- [Las Tostadillas Del Mar Ruta Nader](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BPMpj6nBKyU9Q8438) - seafood restaurant with reasonable
  prices for tacos and tostas.
  The shrimp and tuna tostas are the best thing here.
  The red aguachile is actually surprisingly too spicy, considering I'd been crushing every level of chilli drowning at
  Carbon and had a green aguachile the night before at La Bamba the night before.
  Could do with a better drinks menu, the horchata was far too sweet, skip that next time.
  The wifi didn't work on laptop due to capture portal, but did on phone.
  Skip the tacos and go straight for the tostas next time.
  The tacos are cheap, but like at Carbon, are whole wheat, not so tasty and the ingredients were not properly handled.
  The fried shrimp was massive dough balls on a modest prawn,
  the white fish was a bit better but still way too much batter,
  and the octopus came burnt to a crisp due to all the small pieces of it.
  The mixed seafood toasta on the other hand came nice and crunchy base with excellent ingredient topping,
  shrimp and thicker octopus tentacle pieces, with lots of tomato making it like a mexican bruschetta.
  I would just get two or three of these next time.
  Because the tacos were a bit of a disaster I forgot to even try the 4 sauces.
  I also had to ask for limes,
  there is a small self-service area for this opposite the bar but you'll need a small plate from the staff.
  Wifi capture portal requires name and phone number
- [Tostadas de atun](https://maps.app.goo.gl/M6HiFUncsKnLQ8AY6) - cheap local taco and tostada rrstaurant that is always busy with locals.
  Closes relatively early at 7:30pm (Google Maps is wrong to claim it is open until midnighy).
  The pescado (fish) and cameron (shrimp) tostas are my favourite here.
  Their jamaica water was decent but their horchata was watery and overly sweet, I didn't finish it and would skip that
  next time

### Chichen Itza

[Chichén Itzá](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XyRwnT7SHYCckcLx8) is the archeological ruins of a large Maya city with an iconic
step pyramid - one of the seven wonders of the world due to its mathematical properties and the matroska style temple
within a temple within a temple.

The easiest way to go is with a packaged one day tour that drives you other there and back again.

Your accomodation will likelt offer you one of these, but mine quoted me $90 so I asked a couple tourism vendors in
downtown and got one for $60 instead.

It included a Mayan religious ceremony, followed by a buffet lunch with rice, chicken, beans etc., followed by swimming
in a cenote (an underground cave lake), a stop at a tourist town Valladolid with a nice central park square, and finally
the main event at
Chichén Itzá.

The entry ticket for Chichen Itza was 571 pesos as of late 2025, and considering I paid 1200 pesos for the entire tour
including this ticket, was a reasonable price.

The tour of Chichen Itza was 45 mins of tour guide history, and 45 minutes free roaming to take pictures.

If you have a short fixed schedule like this, do not stop to waste time on all the stall vendors trying to sell you
trinkets as you'll run out of time and miss a lot of the city.

You will be getting heckled all over the place with _"1 dollar, amigo"_ as they try to sell you something.

### Isla Mujeres

Lovely island beaches with fine white sand.

Take the ferry from Puerto Juarez for $35 return.

The ferry usually leaves every 30 minutes and takes about 20 minutes, but there was a one hour gap from 2-3pm.

The ferry had two decks, an open top one and a lower air conditioned one with nicer chairs and a tv. I used the lower shaded air conditioned one on the way there to save my skin from the harsh afternoon sun, and the top on the way back in the evening.

The island itself is a tourist trap, ignore the vendors and restaurants and just do the beach. It’s bad enough to spend $35 on the ferry, but spending 2-3x on tacos or 1000 pesos on a tank top when you can buy one in El Centro for 130-140 is just insulting (even tourist price overcharged ones in El Centro are only 180-200 pesos).

The most busy area is the strip to the north of the ferry port, left as you exit the ferry.

The two main beaches are
[Playa Centro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3THo9utG4htjnF136)
and
[Playa Norte](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2EuoNLSXKixhUCbN6). The first had a long straight coast on the North West side of the island nearest the ferry.
I prefer the latter northern beach which has more of an alcove shape.

There are no public toilets or changing facilities, and in true 3rd world capitalist style you will be expected to pay to use a beach club.

To explore the island hire a golf cart. The first quote I got was 600 pesos, the second 475 and the third 800 for 1 hour 🤬. I went back to the 475 at
[Hotel Cabañas María del Mar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yCkcFUqVUf8r6rgf6)
so that I ended up exactly back at the beach I wanted afterwards).
They say 1 hour isn’t enough to get to the south point of the island and back, but I did it in 40 minutes flat bombing it all the way, overtaking many other golf carts and standing up while going over speed bumps.

As the sun goes down the 6:30pm ferry will be so full you’ll probably have to queue and one will leave full without you, so expect an extra half an hour queueing time at that peak exodus time as the beach empties after sunset.

### Tulum

Coastal town with a ruins of a Mayan port city.

TODO - I ran out of time to do a day trip to here.
