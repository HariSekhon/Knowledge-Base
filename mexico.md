## Airline Check-in & Immigration Control

**WARNING**: the airline refused to check me in without proof of an outbound flight, I had to quickly find and book
something out of Mexico just to check in with 10 minutes left until check-in closure since the check-in closes 1.5 hours
before the flight.

The immigration officer didn't ask for this - the insistant woman at Madrid airport preventing me from speaking to the
check-in desk was either just trying to ruin my day or it's the airlines policy, but it was not the immigration officer.

## Mexican Food

It can be quite confusing with many similar names, so here is a few quick tips:

- Aguachile - raw meat or seafood in a zesty lime-chilli-cilantro sauce, served with nachos or plain untopped tostas / tostadas for you to load it up on to - this is one of my new favourite dishes, although quite extreme by western standards in both lime and chilli, start with the mildest one!
- Tacos - small soft round tortillas - these are actually overrated, I prefer aguachile and tostas
- Tostas / Tostadas - toasted flat tacos topped with meat/seafood and chopped tomato like bruschetta
- Tortas - a sandwich - not to be confused with Tostas!
- Volcane - a toasted crispy tortilla base (aka tosta aka tostada) with melted cheese on it and topped with meat. Named because the cheese is like a volcano

## Mexico City

The capital, reputation for being high crime.

## Yucatan Peninsula

### Cancun

Holiday city on the east coast, famous destination for US spring break students.

Cancun is a tale of two cities:

- the _"Hotel Zone"_ is what you'd imagine, touristy, Americanized, full of huge resorts, where people go to party in
  nightclubs etc.
- El Centro - the centre / downtown - where the local mexican service staff actually live, a ghetto

I'm actually shocked what a 3rd world country Mexico is walking around Cancun central.

I had expected it to be more touristy and fancy,
the tourists must be hiding in the resorts
but walking around the regular streets in search of restaurants is jarring compared to coming from a 1st world city like
Madrid on my prior stop.

#### Travel from Cancun Airport

There is a red bus stand call ADO Aeropuerto, which if you exit Terminal 3 is on the right.
Google Maps tried to send me the wrong way, possibly to Terminal 2's ADO.

The ticket to Cancun costs 145 mexican pesos (£6), 170 pesos (£7) if you're travelling to the hotel zone.

I'm actually surprised it costs this much compared to even places in Europe I can travel to/from the airport for less.

I was told taxis cost around \$30, but actually when I checked it was \$20 on Uber and \$13 on InDrive, so if there are
2-3 of you it's probably better to just take an Uber or InDrive anyway.
Needless to say, don't try to take as a gringo without fixing the price up front.

#### Travel within Cancun

Even if you stay within the Hotel Zone, its still quite a long walk up and down, several kilometers.

If you decide to visit El Centro or save money by staying in a hostel in El Centro, you can forget about walking everywhere as it'll destroy your knees trying.

You will at some point need to either take taxis (see the section below) or learn to use the local buses.

#### Buses in Cancun

Buses are cheap (12 pesos) and there are lots of them as the locals use them extensively.

Taxis while not expensive by international standards are multiple times the cost of a bus.

If you want to live like a local for a more authentic experience, or are travelling on a budget, take the bus.

Unfortunately, Google Maps is absolutely useless as of late 2025 and has absolutely no section on public transport.

To make matter worse, the bus stops are often not well designated, sometimes just a bench at the side of the road without signage.

There are no timetables with bus numbers as you may be used to in 1st world countries.

Interestingly though, you can ask ChatGPT and it will tell you the bus numbers you need and roughly where to catch them down to the road (you need to figure out the direction you need to travel by looking at Google Maps).

#### Taxi Apps in Cancun

- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/en-mx) - bid your price, similar price to Uber, but the real saving is taking a
  motorbike ride which is half the price
- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/)

#### ATMs in Cancun

The Santander ATM in the ADO bus station charged 35 pesos (€1.60) commission when withdrawing 2500 pesos, which was
reasonable compared to ATMs in other countries.

  only one low rated restaurant.
  There were no turtles, only Mexicans.
  Google Maps even has a [phantom incorrect location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1LWXrMALStsKF9N47) for it,
  wasting your time and taxi fares

#### Restaurants in Cancun

- [Carbon Tacos y Miches](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RTvATSPxnvr7UY9C8) - amazing strip steak burrito for 150 pesos (€7)
  and amazing sauces to add to it and plenty of limes.
  My first taste of Cancun & Mexico did not disappoint - this burrito and sauces blows Madrid's TKO Tacos out of the
  water.
  The strip steak burrito is the thing to have here, nice and lean.
  The strip steak taco and volcane are good too.
  All come with a condiment caddy with the following: a pot full of limes, lemon guacamole (mild), but the real stars
  are the chills; chile de pasilla (medium spicy, light red brown, my favourite), chile de habanero (spicy, green),
  chile de arbol (spiciest, dark red-brown).
  I love to cut up a piece of burrito, drench it in lime and then pile on one of the chilli toppings - my favourite
  thing to eat in Mexico so far, I had to return to do this again!
  The _"jamaica water"_ is a nice sweet hibiscus still drink served in a big fancy cocktail glass.
  The horchata is one of the better quality ones I've had with a full cinnamon twig in it, although a bit sweet.
  Alternatively, the Guava water drink is nice too.
  You will need occasional sips of a drink if you are stacking the chillis like me,
  and also the paper napkins for the inevitable running nose from chilli!
  Skip the tacos though, even though they come doubled up, they are less tasty whole wheat tacos and they fall apart
  quickly regardless.
  Also avoid the chicken pieces - they're mediocre and too salty, while the pork chop is ~50% fat and too salty.
  The _"pastor"_ is probably even worse since it's just shawarma meat from the rotating spit like in a kebab shop.
  The cheesecake is the only dessert on the menu but it's mediocre, for 158 pesos ($8.60) I'd skip this next time as
  it's not worth the price or the calories. Stay shredded.
  Wifi 120/177 Mbit/s
- [Las Tostadillas Del Mar Ruta Nader](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BPMpj6nBKyU9Q8438) - seafood restaurant with reasonable
  prices for tacos and tostas.
  The shrimp and tuna tostas are the best thing here.
  The red aguachile is actually surprisingly too spicy, considering I'd been crushing every level of chilli drowning at Carbon and had a green aguachile the night before at La Bamba the night before.
  Could do with a better drinks menu, the horchata was far too sweet, skip that next time.
  The wifi didn't work on laptop due to capture portal, but did on phone.
  Skip the tacos and go straight for the tostas next time.
  The tacos are cheap, but like at Carbon, are whole wheat, not so tasty and the ingredients were not properly handled.
  The fried shrimp was massive dough balls on a modest prawn,
  the white fish was a bit better but still way too much batter,
  and the octopus came burnt to a crisp due to all the small pieces of it.
  The mixed seafood toasta on the other hand came nice and crunchy base with excellent ingredient topping,
  shrimp and thicker octopus tentacle pieces, with lots of tomato making it like a mexican bruschetta.
  I would just get two or three of these next time.
  Because the tacos were a bit of a disaster I forgot to even try the 4 sauces.
  I also had to ask for limes,
  there is a small self-service area for this opposite the bar but you'll need a small plate from the staff.

### Chichen Itza

[Chichén Itzá](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XyRwnT7SHYCckcLx8) is the archeological ruins of a large Maya city with an iconic
step pyramid - one of the seven wonders of the world due to its mathematical properties and the matroska style temple within a temple within a temple.

The easiest way to go is with a packaged one day tour that drives you other there and back again.

Your accomodation will likelt offer you one of these, but mine quoted me $90 so I asked a couple tourism vendors in downtown and got one for $60 instead.

It included a Mayan religious ceremony, followed by a buffet lunch with rice, chicken, beans etc., followed by swimming in a cenote (an underground cave lake), a stop at a tourist town Valladolid with a nice central park square, and finally the main event at  
Chichén Itzá.

The entry ticket for Chichen Itza was 532 pesos as of late 2025, and considering I paid 1200 pesos for the entire tour including this ticket, was a reasonable price.

The tour of Chichen Itza was 45 mins of tour guide history, and 45 minutes free roaming to take pictures.

If you have a short fixed schedule like this, do not stop to waste time on all the stall vendors trying to sell you trinkets as you'll run out of time and miss a lot of the city.

You will be getting heckled all over the place with _"1 dollar, amigo"_ as they try to sell you something.

### Tulum

Coastal town with a ruins of a Mayan port city.
