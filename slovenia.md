## Motorway Tolls - Vignettes in Slovenia

You must purchase a vignette for using Slovenia's motorways, you can buy them online here:

<https://www.gov.si/en/topics/tolls/>

Alternatively you can buy them at the border by taking the other lane for it. Save time, buy it online.

## Wifi in Slovenia

Slovenia has surprisingly bad wifi in many places ranging from the hostel to coffee shops and restaurants,
it is painfully slow and unreliable.

Do not stay at Hostel Tivoli again, the wifi didn't work a lot of the time.

If you do stay at Hostel Tivoli,
walk through the park to the centre, it's a much nicer walk and shaded most of the way by trees.

## Ljubljana

**No Grocery Store Alcohol after 9pm!**

Many young people have the smart idea of buying cheap alcohol at the grocery store and drinking in the lovely park but
beware that even grocery stores open later until 10pm like [Mercator](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AgYuahno5jAfhyEM6) will
not sell alcohol to you past 9pm.
I believe this is a government regulation to force you to pay the tourist trap bars!
... which means more tax revenue for government too.
You don't hate the government enough. :wink:

- [Wonderland](https://maps.app.goo.gl/p5TD6eByJPzzmAft7) - in "Hotel Center", I walked past it and struggled to find
  it following Google Maps, but worth the find.
  A perfect Instagrammable place with excellent decor and great menu full of fancy drinks, desserts, all day brunch with
  eggs, acai and oatmeal bowls, pistacchio specials, "Instagrammable Coffees" eg. Ferrero Rocher coffee or pistacchio
  coffee with rims of pistacchios or other nuts, the wonder mocha looks amazing, a full range of cocktails and
  mocktails, salads and main courses.
  The classic breakfast (€12) is my preferred breakfast here, with 3 sunny side up fried eggs, 2 bacon rashers, 3 small toasts and mushrooms.
  The Eggs Royale with salmon was good too, and the extra poached egg for €2.30 wasn't really necessary
  as it's a decent amount of food.
  The Eggs Benedict doesn't come with ham so it's a bit basic,
  for €1 difference it's better to go with the Eggs Royale and get some salmon,
  or else the classic breakfast with bacon and 3 eggs.
  The Acai bowl is rich, cold, with frozen berries, granola and heart biscuits.
  Wifi 6/4 Mbit/s
- [Barbarella Juice Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/11iGQAXvdURCNM9B6) - fresh juices, smoothies, sandwiches, salads, soup,
  acai smoothie / oat / yoghurt bowls. Wifi is open but slow 2/0.2 Mbit/s. Closes at 8pm so get there early
- [R&B Cafe Roasters](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Sbg5YAFzo3xGMkxP9) - gentrified coffee shop, with a name like this you
  just have to visit it. Closes at 6pm.
  The Acai bowl comes deep but not wide so has a moderate amount of fruit toppings, granola and almond flakes.
  The Acai bowl at Barbarella is better though, in both toppings and richness with a deeper darker purple. No Wifi!
- [Patron Tacos & Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gGj3kgaThCyAD8wo8) - popular tacos restaurant with reasonable prices and
  nice outdoor seating, inside with stool seating, outdoor benches probably aren't great for winter.
  The horchata drink (€4) is really nice, a sweet coconut milk drink with a cinnamon stick in it,
  and comes in a good size (400ml?) unlike a lot of juice drinks here which are often a meagre 2dl (200ml).
  The fried white fish taco (€5.50) comes absolutely loaded, you will struggle to not drop pieces all over your plate.
  The shrimp taco (€5.50) is smaller and seriously spicy - they apologise on the menu that they cannot make it less
  spicey, probably because the chilli paste covering the shrimp is already made.
  Two tacos were plenty of food for me, they made a mistake and brought me 2 fish tacos instead of 1 shrimp one,
  so when they brought me the missing shrimp one I ended up with 3 tacos
  and couldn't finish the spare white fish taco anyway.
  Overall good value for money compared to other places in the city, and a contender for the best €15 I spent in
  Ljubljana. Wifi 9/8 Mbit/s
- [Pop's Place Burger Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pbmCcioYuthJ73Va8) - good burgers, not too big.
  The fries with herbs and parmesan has a lot of grated parmesan on it, totally worth it.
  The homemade lemonade with ginger is good but not sweet. Wifi 39/8 Mbit/s
- [Le Petit Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zyFidPCx2SHuYSYC6) - popular restaurant with good outdoor seating. Breakfast
  menu ends at 12pm though so get there early.
  The eggs royale with salmon is decent but not too big since it's only the 2 topped muffins comes with nothing on the
  side. Could have eaten two of them.
  Wifi 1.8/0.8 Mbit/s
- [Slovenska Hiša - Figovec](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VYKV7YAM4BFZyRLRA) - service was very slow to seat, 4 staff members
  walked past and ignored me and the crowd of people that developed behind me queuing at the door for about 10 minutes,
  until one of them finally acknowledged our existence and said "You'll all have to wait!" in an abrupt manner.
  Charming! The menu is actually pretty good though, with a good selection and reasonable pricing.
  The restaurant occupancy and ambience was good too.
  The goulash came extremely quickly, they obviously keep it ready to go,
  and was actually quite good, with a mix of pork, beef and deer - one of the better ones I've had across Europe,
  although still not as good as my exe's one (just like no Italian restaurant has ever made a bolognese as good as mine,
  they probably wouldn't be willing to spend as much on ingredients).
  The goulash is a stew and came with warm sliced baguette (which would have been better buttered but with the staff
  situation I decided not to bother asking for butter as the food would probably be cold if I did).
  The Wifi didn't work but managed to use another nearby open wifi
- [Hot Horse](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rg1xGNevG82NCmer8) - large bap horse burgers from reconstituted meat, quite good,
  located in [Tivoli Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZWRyGipZuc1y58md8)
- [Hallo Leskovac](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Jr9bHb8sub1pWuiDA) - late night burger and cevapcici fast food
- [Captain's Cabin](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XNuxkEiSZVWT7q936) - dive bar with Spotify juke box
- [Central Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PKRS1xz6Qn9appfVA)
- [Open Kitchen Market](https://whereisthemarket.com/market/open-kitchen-market-ljubljana/) - lots of food stalls every
  Friday from mid-March to October

- [Cacao](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MspPuhR3sFcCDPDd9) - popular coffee and ice cream shop, looks amazing

## Bled

A good day trip destination with a large picturesque lake, historic churches, food stall parade, souvenirs and many
restaurants.
Visited by many foreigners and locals.

It's only around 35 minutes from Ljubljana bombing down the motorway by car, but you can also get there by bus.

- [Lake Bled](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4HNweRwz223Ho1mEA) - the walking trail around the lake is around 6km which will
  take you roughly 1 hour 30 minutes, depending on how often you stop to take pictures as there are many scenic
  viewpoints
- [Bled Castle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4hMngTakzocVPHDm9) on a cliff edge
- [Restavracija Central Bled](https://maps.app.goo.gl/si5qLojW1ea5DJDu8) - good menu and moderate prices.
  The "Central plate", like a mixed grill, was good with a lot of meat: Rumpsteak, pork tenderloin, Carnolian sausage
  with Slovenian cottage cheese rolled dumpling and sautéed potatoes with onions in natural sauce.
  Fast Wifi 453/142 even outside

## Novo Mesto

For the 7th biggest city in Slovenia, this is one horse town that was dead on a Sunday afternoon.

Ok for a 1 hour stopover, but not much there.

Much of the public street parking is free on Sundays.

- [Bistro Marof](https://maps.app.goo.gl/35ZiLXoQAttw85HL8) - has a good selection of ice creams outside, and good
  outdoor covered seating as well as decently styled interior air conditioned seating.
  There is parking outside too.
  Wifi 7/4 Mbit/s
- [Parkirišče - Novi trg](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TtqcF8UyUJCbiqY19) - public car park with plenty of space, free on
  Sundays
