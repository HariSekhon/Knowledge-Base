Mostly narrow AI.

General AI mirroring what humans have is not real yet.

### LLM

#### Ollama

<https://github.com/ollama/ollama>

Ollama Open WebUI + engine which is prompt-based, similar to ChatGPT, ask questions, get responses.
It's completely local, it doesn't go to the internet.

Engine nodes run on GPUs.

The query response is very slow and prints a few words a second when using CPUs instead of GPUs.

Performance decline after consecutive questions.

Why does the performance degrade after one query?
