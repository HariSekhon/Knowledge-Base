Ollama Open WebUI + engine which is prompt-based, similar to ChatGPT, ask questions, get responses.
It's completely local, it doesn't go to the internet.

Engine nodes run on GPUs.

The query response is very slow and prints a few words a second when using CPUs instead of GPUs.

Performance decline after consecutive questions.
