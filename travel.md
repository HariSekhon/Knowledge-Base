## Booking Sites

[Agoda.com](https://www.agoda.com/) - the best site for use in Asia, and you really need to go to Asia, it's amazing.

[SkyScanner.net](https://www.skyscanner.net/) - had cheaper flights that weren't even found on Expedia,
and cheaper on the same flights too

[Kayak.com](https://www.kayak.com/) - even cheaper than SkyScanner and had cheaper flights not found on Expedia

[Booking.com](https://www.booking) - cheaper and more hotels than Expedia

[Expedia](https://expedia.co.uk) - LEGACY DO NOT USE.
Was my usual go to as it usually had the most options at the last minute, until SkyScanner and Kayak
showed it up.
Beware if you are trying
to get a hotel immediately for a missed flight the app will shunt the results to the next day
and you will end up booking the wrong night and then having a horrible battle trying to get it refunded.
Booking.com is better for that scenario.
Also, if you book the wrong date or there is any issue Expedia support are the worse ever.
You will struggle to get any refund.
Use them to find the hotels and flights,
then go book directly with the airline or hotel and deal with them directly if there is any problem.
You'll usually get a slight discount or other perk and when there is a problem you will not be stuck suffering Expedia
chat support.

[AirBnb](https://www.airbnb.com) - compare the cost of apartments to hotels in each area, it alternates which is
cheaper.

[LastMinute.com](https://lastminute.com) - ok for package holidays but assumed return flights,
less good for a digital nomad who is going one way and bouncing to the next place.

[OnTheBeach.co.uk](https://www.onthebeach.co.uk/) - good prices but nothing available for same/next day for last minute
travellers like me.

## Flights

Book ahead of time for better price comparisons.

Same goes for ferries if driving.

Favourite Airline: Air Arabia because they didn't tell me to put my laptop away during takeoff. One less pointless rule
enforced.

### Flights Gotchas

#### Transfer Flight Timings

**Do not take transfer flights with less than 3-4 hours between them.**

It is common for the first flight to be delayed by 1.5 hours
and then you don't have enough time to catch the second flight.
Even more so if you have to go through security again.

I have gotten stranded overnight in Warsaw like this on the way from London to Tbilisi, with no replacement flight for
24 hours.
And of course there is no hotel availability at 11:30pm except for £200-300+ per night hotels.

#### Self Transfer

Avoid `Self Transfer`.

This is a hack by comparison sites matching unrelated airline flights.

If the first flight is delayed, which is common, the other airline won't care or wait for you.

You will lose the second flight you paid for.
They try to sell you additional insurance in this case to potentially offer you another
flight but who's to say that will be the next decent flight instead of the cheapest possible.

This is how you can get stranded at airports for awfully long periods of time wearing you down.

I've learnt this one the hard way when my flight from Tbilisi, Georgia, to Antalya, Turkey, was delayed by 1hr30mins
so I had no chance of catching the other flight which was only 2 hours apart.
Worse still it was at another terminal
that was 2km away so I even had to take a taxi to the other terminal for the other flight.

You will also lose time collecting luggage, going through a new check-in, security again etc.

Stick to the same airline transfers, they will be aware that their counterpart flight was delayed
and are more likely to hold the flight to give everyone time to transfer.

#### Change Airport

Beware there is no `CHANGE AIRPORT` stopover as you'd have to travel between airports across a city or region
and this makes it even more likely that you'll miss a connecting flight.

It's even worse than the `Self Transfer`.

## Hotels vs Airbnb

Hotels and [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com) vary as to which one is cheaper by location.

Check both.

The earlier you book the better deals you'll get.

I have on many occasions booked accommodation in the airport lounge minutes before boarding planes
but I do not recommend this.
I have have private hosts cancel my accommodations the day before or even the same day of my arrival
(see [Morocco](#morocco)).

It's annoying to be booking at the last minute because you'll get the least good places for the most expensive prices.

### Hotel & Airbnb - Parking

If driving, make sure to double check parking at hotels or Airbnbs.

If Expedia shows `Parking Available` include of `Parking Included`, that means there will be parking charges,
which can be quite high.

You have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the hotel listing to find out what the charges are in the small print.

When driving, I often prefer booking places a bit away from the centers to get easier parking as many central
accomodations, both hotels and airbnbs lack good parking.

Also, if you're only going into the centres in the evenings, often you can get cheap or even free parking.

## Mobile Internet Access

### EU

If you're not an EU resident or don't have an EU sim, skip to the next section [Rest of World](#rest-of-world).

I've used my UK sim from [Smarty](https://smarty.co.uk) across all the EU countries I visited as it permits use of your
plan's bundled service within EU countries at no extra charge, and the monthly contract is cheap as chips.

Now that is progress!

- included calls
- included texts
- up to 12GB of your data plan
  - I actually increased my data plan because I used it for GPS everywhere, and didn't want
    to risk running out

There is a tweak you need to make to your phone to enable it for roaming:

<https://smarty.co.uk/roaming-setup>

which basically comes down to changing your Mobile Service data MMS APN to `mob.asm.net` in your phone settings.

### Rest of World

#### Digital e-sims

You can buy data plans for a certain number of days.

Google [travel e-sims](https://www.google.com/search?q=travel+e-sims)
and add the country you are travelling to for more options.

- [Airalo](https://www.airalo.com/) - follow the installation instructions and make sure to enable `Data Roaming`
  under the e-sim settings otherwise the internet won't connect
- [Saily](https://saily.com/)
- [Holafly](https://esim.holafly.com/)

## International Calls using VoIP over the Internet

Because banks and other legacy providers will force you to call them, you can use one of these services:

- [Viber](https://account.viber.com/en/call-united-kingdom) - 1 week free trial, $5.99 afterwards for unlimited calls,
  but again does not apply to premium or non-geographic numbers like banks often use,
  worked on Barclays number that MoreMins was not processing voice
- [MoreMins](https://www.moremins.com/) - quick, cheap and easy, has an app, £5 for 30 days of unlimited calls,
  use 0800 number to your bank, as premium / national numbers like banks are often using will incur high per-minute
  charges. Blocked me from using Barclays 0800 number. Possible bust option
- [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com/rates) - cheaper than Skype for national calls but hard to use as a foreigner,
  limited to 10 countries, need to use a [VPN](vpn.md) just to try to access it, disappointing usability
- [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/international-calls/) - £5 for 400 minutes, expensive for national numbers like most
  banks and businesses use

## Dining Out

Use [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com) (see [Mobile Internet Access](#mobile-internet-access) section).

Filter by:

- `Top Rated` on phone or `4.5+` Star rating on desktop
- Distance
- Price eg. `£, ££` or `£££` if it's date night
- Prefer restaurants with higher number of reviews to reduce likelihood of fake reviews swaying / gaming the system

Places just outside the centres are often better value for money and top quality food,
but some central places are great too.

I leave a couple recommendations in each location listed below.

Some places don't have English menus -
these are often the best places that aren't so spoilt by foreign money and tourist trap
churn allowing them to lower their standards.

You will need to use a [Translation App](#translation) ...

## Translation

If travelling to a non-English speaking country, I recommend downloading the
[Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/about/) app:

- Translates typed words
- Translates spoken words into typed words and immediately translates them
- Translates pictures replacing words into another language
  - uses Google Lens [AI](ai.md)
- Large list of supported languages
- Optional: download language support when on wifi
  - didn't notice this making much impact on my data plan either way

## Beware Foreign Police & Customs

You may not understand how despicable institutional corruption is until you've had a first hand run-in with it.

I have been shaken down, fined or blackmailed by Police in countries ranging from South Africa to Latvia to Serbia,
had an
[invasive car search in Sweden](https://medium.com/@harisekhon/the-police-attention-you-get-driving-a-drug-dealer-looking-car-through-europe-d38c5919835f),
and was randomly stopped and questioned a couple times by the UK police on occasions I wore a hoodie
(with hood down during peak daytime 9am-2pm walking along the pavement slowly in broad daylight, not hiding my face).

<!-- TODO: link to medium article on random stop and search experiences -->

**Do not give the police any excuse to stop you.**

### Carry Your Official Documents Everywhere For When You _Are_ Stopped

Carry all of your documents on you safely in case you are stopped
(see [Driving](#driving) section checklist).

### Don't Speed

See the [Driving](#driving) section for more on this.

### Do Not Even Jaywalk

Do not walk across road crossings during red men pedestrian traffic signs as some countries have laws against
_"jay walking"_
which the police may choose
to only enforce against you as a foreigner etc. Some Police wait at major traffic light crossing
waiting for gullible foreigners to make this fineable mistake.

![Dont_trust_the_police](images/dont_need_gun_police_will_protect_you_thought_you_didnt_trust_police.jpeg)

**ps. don't carry guns to other countries! You will almost certainly get put in jail !!**

**pps. Don't even carry tools or anything remotely sharp.
I've even had my shaving razors taken off me at airports -
you never know how they will treat you in a foreign place and it varies significantly.**

## Driving

Ferries are surprisingly expensive, similar in price to an air fair.

This probably works out a little more economical if having more than one person in the car.

You should book ahead of time due to limited slots, and for better pricing.

EU countries have town symbols along routes which automatically drop the speed limit to 50kmph whether they declare it
explicitly or not.

This is a local knowledge that will get you done and your license revoked if you hit 100kmph. See [Latvia](#latvia).

### Driving Checklist

Police may refuse you entry or blackmail you out of money if you don't have all of the following documents:

- Passport:
  - South African police laid a trap pulling over foreigners coming out of
    [Sandton](#sandton) - primarily a rich foreigner area.
    My guess is they were targeting rental cars in an attempt to extort fines / bribes from foreigners not carrying
    their passports and even document imaginable including driving license and international driver's permit.
    <!-- TODO: medium story this full exchange -->
- UK driver's license
- International driver's permit (get this from the Post Office it's only around £5 but requires a passport photo)
- Insurance certificate
- Vehicle Registration V5C paper proof of ownership
  - [Serbian](#serbia) police refused to accept digital proof of ownership via insurance certificate
  - they insisted on physical original paper copy
  - they said it was the equivalent to *"Passport for the car"*

### Additional EU Driving Checklist

Driving in the EU additionally requires:

- breakdown kit (AA does one), including:
  - high viz jacket (which must be available in the passenger compartment
  - breakdown triangle
  - headlamp converters

Headlamp converters are basically headlamp stickers that change the glare direction of your headlamps to shine the other
way because you drive on the right in Europe instead of the left like in the UK.

Apparently the French police are likely to pull you over and fine you if you don't have these.

### Do Not Speed

Do not speed, you only need to go a meagre 50kmh above the speed limit and the [Latvian](#latvia) police will revoke
your license.

This is easy to do in towns which are set to only 50kmph speed limits whether they explicitly declare it or not.

If you see a car pushing into the back of you, do not speed up.

It may be a police car that will only put on its siren after you've increased speed to breach the +50kmph maximum
penalty of €360 euros and a revoked license.

The extended time pulled over by the police not knowing if they are going to arrest you and impound your vehicle on top
of revoking your license will set you back a lot more time than any speed up would give you.

It's quite possible they do this on purpose 15 minutes from the Estonia border to catch unsuspecting foreigners driving
between the countries.

Let cars overtake you than fall for this unmarked police car entrapment.

### EU Roaming

My UK phone number worked across all European countries I travelled through, including:

- France
- Germany
- Poland
- Lithuania
- Latvia
- Estonia
- Sweden
- Slovakia
- Hungary

It stopped working when I got to Serbia which is not in the EU.

Going from EU to non-EU was a bit of a jarring experience.

There may be something to the EU integration project after all.

## Emigration

### Taxes

Brits leaving in the middle of a UK tax year (April 6th - April 5th next year) will have a declare a split tax year to
HMRC.

It's best to plan ahead and leave just before April 5th to not contaminate another next tax year with HMRC able to claim
tax off you that quite frankly the UK doesn't deserve at this point.

### Mail Redirection

Brits may want to [redirect their mail overseas](https://www.postoffice.co.uk/mail/redirection) or
get a [PO Box](https://www.royalmail.com/receiving/po-box) to collect on return visits.

## Countries

Some more specific tips for different countries.

Number of Countries: 26

### Austria

#### Vienna

A good destination for a long weekend. This capital feels sparse to a Londoner.

The taxi driver said young people leave because there isn't enough to do,
but it's good for a weekend city break with the girlfriend, especially if you like central european architecture,
and just for this next recommendation.

[Casino Wien](https://www.casinos.at/casinos/wien/casino-restaurant) is probably the best restaurant in Vienna. It is
above the casino, which was surprisingly not fancy at all, smokey and low grade.
But the restaurant above was a different story.

Try the Chateaubriand for two with your girlfriend - only top restaurants do it.

### Belgium

Nice small country, easy to drive from the UK, perhaps 2-3 hours after a ferry from Dover to Calais.

#### Antwerp

Port city, not much there from what I recall, been to a good restaurant there but can't remember its name.

#### Brussels

A bit of a western capital dump with high immigration, graffiti etc.

#### Bruges / Brugge

West Belgium is nicer, with Bruges having a historic town catering to tourists with restaurants, ice creams and
coffee shops.

[Marco Polo Noodles](https://www.marco-polo-noodles.com/) is recommended on the main strip.

#### Ghent / Gent

City with a mix of old and new, not quite as nice as Bruges, but better than Brussels.

[Seli's Noodle Bar](https://www.selinoodlebar.be/) and [Soup Lounge](https://www.souplounge.be/) are both recommended
here, and both are very affordable.

#### Liege

Liege is worse than Brussels, with high incidence of homelessness and street begging.

#### Waterloo

Gentrified town just south of Brussels where Napoleon lost the famous battle.

[Le Bar À Soupe](https://www.facebook.com/people/Le-Bar-%C3%A0-Soupe/100063541241931/),
Savage Burger and [Thai Cafe](https://thai.cafe/en) are recommended here, with the latter being more expensive.
You will need your Google Translate camera app to translate the menu as they don't speak English.

### Canada

It's been most of a lifetime since I've been.

Similar to the US, but with cheaper healthcare.

#### Abbotsford

Just outside Vancouver, the basements of their houses are bigger than UK houses.
They often have gyms, cinema rooms, and pool tables there, as well as spare bedrooms.

Coming back to the UK from there was quite a downgrade.

### Czech Republic / Czechia

Sorry but I can't call it Czechia.

It's too close in naming to the war torn Chechnia.
They didn't think about about the negative branding on this rename.

#### Prague

A brilliant historic capital, famed for cheap beer and English stag parties.
There are literally signs on the front of venues that say *"No English stag parties"*.
Such is the bad reputation of the English lads on holiday!

Prague has many good restaurants and excellent architecture in the old town.

### Cyprus

Excellent holiday destination, but be warned, it is too hot in August.

### Estonia

The best of the three Baltic countries IMO, with prettier women and just generally feels slightly more developed.

#### Tallinn

Tallinn, the capital, can be done in 2 days. There are plenty of good restaurants to visit.

[Olde Hansa](https://www.oldehansa.ee/) medievil restaurant is highly recommended. It's expensive but worth it.
It has live medieval music, the staff are tunics, and the food is fit for royalty. You can even get bear on the menu.

### France

A surprising number of people in France do not speak English at all.

If you've been travelling to other countries where they often accommodate English speakers this might come as a
surprise for a country close to England.

#### Dunkirk

Good for a stopover on your way to Beligum from the UK ferrying to Calais.

#### Paris

*"A less good version of London"* as my colleague described it.

The capital is heavily immigrated from Africa, with lots of graffiti and not very nice metro.

I have literally been told off for not speaking French as a visitor. Much less welcoming than other parts of the world.

The many Chateaux outside of Paris in the French countryside are nice though
(I used to go every year with a company for retreats).

### Georgia

Georgia was too cold by October.

#### Georgia Flights

Flights in and out of Georgia to the capital Tbilisi are a nightmare as it's hard to get a direct flight.
They often require stopover transfer flights in Turkey or other countries like Poland.

Flights in and out of the transfer cities are often delayed, causing you to miss your transfers
and end up stranded for 24 hours waiting for another flight to Tbilisi and having to take expensive hotels and rebook
flights at losses.

I missed my transfer flights both in and out of Tbilisi. This is probably one of the worst things about Georgia.

This is how I came up with the [Flights Gotchas section](#flights-gotchas).

#### Georgia Taxies

Do not use Airport taxis, they are double the price of using the Bolt app.

- [Bolt](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bolt-request-a-ride/id675033630) - used this was half the price of the official
  Airport taxi
- [Yandex Taxi](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yandex-go-taxi-food-delivery/id472650686)

#### Tbilisi Airport

Tbilisi Airport wifi sucks.

It disconnects all the time and insists on giving a swipe right advertisement for investments before letting you
complete the networking setup.

Except you can't swipe on a laptop and pressing any combination of the right arrow and meta keys doesn't work.

So you can't connect your laptop to the airport wifi, only your phone.

#### Tibilisi

- [Chika](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ukVeBmmArPPczDGs7) - stylish gentrified cafe with good food and desserts too.
  The potato waffle with smoked salmon and poached on on top was a very good small plate meal in between meals.
  The Bumble coffee & orange juice mix was not my thing though.
  If you like chocolate try a Kartoshka little chocolate log dessert
- Santino - excellent 24x7 modcoffee bar - excellent drinks menu,
  good food menu, bit pricey by local standards but good ambience.
  They have _"Laptop Free Zone"_ stickers on every table (which I take exception to!) but it's quiet enough at night
  that it's not enforced.
  South just off Liberty Square a few doors closer to the square than
  [Bernard](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QG1TE4sq3LH7PXX89), not the Santino on Atoneli St that Google Maps finds which
  closes at 11pm.
- [Gloria Jean](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qKu3MUHQR5di9UpZ7) - good coffee shop in Liberty Square,
  the cherry juice is very nice, although the chai latte is a little too sweet IMO, ask them to add less powder
- [11:11 Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7kYuxEh4BPceUvev8) - good coffee spot but unfortunately always closes well before
  its Google Maps hours of midnight, often closed by 11pm.
  Gloria Jeans and Santino are far more reliable late night spots
- [Khinkali Bar N1](https://maps.app.goo.gl/D9igfusLuBNzkGue8) - affordable food place specializing in traditional
  Georgian dumplings called Khinkali
- [Salobie Bia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9UhPzRVDgBT1mfFi8) - affordable local eats place set in a large basement with
  impressive art decor all around with good ambience and background piano music.
  Menu is a bit limited on non-alcoholic drinks.
  Recommended to me by a local
- [Pasanauri](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MQCwW54s7MRHsoNs6) - moderately priced good food,
  the Khinkali mixed meat dumplings were very good and affordable, the aubergine walnut while a recommended speciality
  I found a bit much, you'd need two aubergine lovers to manage it.
  There are also a couple lovely dogs that hang around to eat scraps and occasionally bark as passers by,
  whom I can only assume they sense are evil...
- [Ode Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Xs4Vq6zcoXEn9KpK6) - live piano music at alfresco outdoor dining, more limited menu
  than Pasanuri and bit pricier (you're probably paying for the piano) but still good.
  The 10 Khinkali big meat dumplings and Kharcho soup are both good, but together are too much food.
- [Ramekai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NG1L1dCfpspMFB2u5) -
  Japanese sushi and ramen place if you want a break from Georgian food being soup and dumplings everywhere.
  Skip the deep fried popcorn chicken starter and go for the Miso Ramen.

### Germany

#### Driving in Germany

The autobahn - the german highway - is long.

If you have a need for speed, Germany is probably one of the best places to drive your car.

Germany is a much bigger country which you feel after driving through Belgium and then hitting the much more vast
driving distances in Germany.

You can expect to drive for 8 hours to go from West to East Germany.

#### Bonn

TODO

#### Berlin

Berlin is a relatively affordable capital with good restaurants
and what feels like much lower population density than London.

It is not as popping as London at 9pm on a Saturday night as a result though.

#### Brandenburg

A small town to the West of Berlin with some old gothic buildings, a good place to walk around with an ice cream.

#### Cologne

Large cathedral city with a selection of restaurants.

[Fräulein Herborths](https://www.fraeuleinherborths.de/) is recommended here.

#### Dusseldorf

A city with a great selection of restaurants.

"Shawarma city" takeaway is recommended here, good food and good prices.
There is often a queue around the corner for it across the hours of the evening.

#### Essen

Surprisingly mass immigrated with a lot of graffiti, with homeless people along the high street.

Limited dining options, middle eastern probably being among the best options.

#### Frankfurt

Large metropolitan multicultural city with many restaurants.

[MA'LOA Poké Bowl](https://maloa.com/) is recommended, and [BKK Thai Street Food](https://bkkthaistreetfood.com/) is also popular.

#### Hanover

A city with a lot of middle eastern restaurants.

[Zambezi Springs](https://www.zambezi-springs.de/) is recommended here - rare access to good African cuisine.

#### Königswinter

Lovely small germanic town. This is what I imagined German paradise to look like.

[Gasthaus Lichtenberg](https://gasthaus-lichtenberg.de/) is recommended here.

#### Potsdam

City just outside the west of Berlin.

[KOI Sushi, Grill & Soup](https://koi-sushi-grill.eatbu.com/) is highly recommended here. They don't speak English but
it's worth the translation effort, excellent food and good prices.
The Thai tom yum soup and the sushi are recommended.

### Italy

#### Rome

Been a long time, there are Gelato ice cream places everywhere.

#### Venice

Steps everywhere, do not go with children and especially not with a buggy. You will spend all day carrying the buggy up
and down steps, which is hardly a holiday.

Somewhat expensive, don't go for more than a long weekend.

Also, got caught in a storm just before leaving, check the weather forecasts.

### Moldova

#### Chisinau

You'll need to withdraw local currency before you leave the airport.

There were hardly any taxis outside the airport and lots of people waiting around for them.

The wall said 150-200 Moldovan Leu to the centre but when taxi drivers finally showed up they started quoting me
300-400 and cash only.

After my experience in Turkey and this I have started to dislike how taxi drivers are taking tourists for mugs.

I ended up taking the Number 30 bus to the centre instead which was easy (again cash only, thanks to a good samaritan
because I made the mistake of not withdrawing cash before leaving the airport).
Some of these less developed countries like Moldova and Morocco demand cash usage (probably to evade taxes).

- [La Placinte](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6yVUsipRBWWSfpBp8) - affordable but good quality chain restaurant, there are
  several of them you don't have to go to this location

- [Andy's](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fewkr3FsDjW2rZfUA) - affordable chain known for pizzas,
  the central one is 24x7 and packed at midnight on a Saturday as one of the few late night places available.

- [Keller Holz Gastropub](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pr7sK1L7MnSwy5py5) - good food and beer menus, very good ambience and
  location

- [Sensei Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7vMPz3KZbppy3iudA) - good looking menu, little pricey by local standards,
  outside terrace, has wifi, good ambience but shisha smokey indoors

- [Cartal](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aDCJVHnDE2z2rWKQ7) - decent food, moderate prices, small indoor bar seating,
  all restaurant seating is outdoors, card ok until 10pm, takes only cash 10pm-12am closing time

- [Daily Dose](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LoncFKxbs6hvBCwJ6) - busy trendy late night cocktails and desserts venue,
  no hot drinks for late night workers

- [Amor Amar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EroDq4vsNi2Zzd78A) - trendy small late night drinks & dessert venue with good
  music, slightly expensive due to late night premium open until 2am

- [Grill House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WBD1c5GHKspgDf8A6) - established in 1995, decent quality, price `£££` -
  the traditional Georgian soup Kharcho with veal is slightly spicey but very good and much bigger than anticipated,
  watch out you can still handle your main.
  New York Cheesecake was good, and fillet steak was decent but far from the best I've had internationally.
  For non-alcoholics with a sweet tooth the local Compot fruit juice drink is recommended,
  I had 3 of them and was probably well over my sugar intake a result.
  Regarding, steak on a price trade off I'd probably try one of the other steak places next time.

### Latvia

The sour cabbage soup in a bread bowl is the local speciality.

See the [Do Not Speed](#do-not-speed) section.

#### Riga

Riga, the capital, is nice for a visit for perhaps 2 days.

You will run out of things to do.

[Rozengrāls](https://rozengrals.lv/en/#nav) medieval restaurant is recommended.
They do a suckling piglet spit roast only on Friday and Saturdays.

Check out the view from St Peter's Church, they will charge €9 for entry to the tower.
Capitalism applies even to the church it seems.

### Lithuania

Lithuania is noticeably poorer than Poland.

There is a common Georgian restaurant chain which is well worth a visit for their traditional soup.

#### Vilinus

Vilnius, the capital, is worth a visit but you don't really need more than a couple days as it's not that big.

[Chačapuri](https://www.facebook.com/GeorgianBakery/) is a recommended restaurant. It's a Georgian chain with an
excellent traditional Georgian soup with beef and vegetables with a bit of spice.
Another traditional dish Khachapuri is basically a similar to a pizza but with more dough around the edges.
A bit bready for my liking but something you may want to try once.

### Morocco

The menus are in French!

There are stray cats everywhere.

I got food poisoning in Morocco.

If you have a curious nose, Morocco is a land of intrigue with a bounty of interesting produce in bazaars.
Not all smells are pleasant though.
If you have a sensitive nose you may have had your nasal fill pretty quickly
(or if you're struggling with food poisoning with many smells making your frequently stomach churn for days).
Do not book a long time in Morocco on your first visit in case you don't like the constant smells.

In the bazaars, do not let local people _"help"_ you by leading to you places,
they are clearing getting kickbacks by the owners to lead you to 3.7 star places that you would not choose.
When you decide to not stay, and they don't get their kickbacks, they then start hassling your for direct *tips*.

Use Google Maps instead (see the [e-sim data section](#digital-e-sims) above) and rely on reviews of places with high
numbers of reviews to reduce the likelihood of swaying / gaming the system fake reviews.

Below are some I have visited personally and the better ones I'd recommend.

There are also old women almost shouting at you as you pass by in native language (presumably aggressive begging).
This is probably what western feminists would be doing if they weren't
[stealing so much of your income](https://avoiceformen.com/featured/research-finds-that-as-a-group-only-men-pay-tax/)
via the high tax and inflationary money printing feminist-socialist welfare state.
I prefer the Moroccan system here as this situation implies more consent for men (you can safely ignore them),
but actually the Moroccan tax rates are still far too high (of course they are, they have universal suffrage).

#### Morocco Taxis

- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/en-ma) - cheaper and good taxi app, you can pre-agree the fee up front
  (still have to pay cash not in app)
- [Careem](https://www.careem.com/) - the same super popular Careem app that I still had installed from [Dubai](#dubai)
  worked here without having to change anything
- Airport Taxis are the worst - do not use them - they overcharged me 3x
  - they quote every idiot coming out of the airport 150 MAD which I only realized was a rip off when I asked a local
    and was recommended to use the InDrive app to go back to the airport - it quoted me only 54 MAD for an instant
    guarantee of any driver in the area without me bidding a price which could be lower
  - The Airport Taxis are thieves, and they also even insist on cash

#### Tangiers

Beach city in northern Morocco.

[Le Mekong](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Kot4Ec67qZNFuxTy8) - great sushi and vietnamese food.
The spicy shrimp with rice was great and
the Isla Blanca fried sushi with pineapple was excellent.
They also do wooden boats filled with a selection of sushi.
Has Wifi.

[Boutique Burger](https://maps.app.goo.gl/k1D2MvJyEvzLWZcf6) - possibly the best fries I've ever had anywhere, crispy
deep fried on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.
The popular Texas pulled beef burger was great,
the greek salad was a good size with very good ingredients but an average dressing.
Of course there is fresh orange juice at a reasonable price, as there is in many places in Morocco.
Bring your travel adapter because there's Wifi and plugs by the tables.

[Restaurant Cafe La Playa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Lrep4uahqy88cERR6) - cash only but great Moroccan food, prices and
service, with a very comfortable upstairs lounge area and wifi.
I recommend the Tajine with beef and prunes,
the Moroccan salad (side) and the lentils starters. The bread is home made and very good too,
fresh squeezed juices are both well priced and good sizes.
Wifi and plugs available upstairs, and if you site on one end youhave an open window view of the sea.
Worth the discovery.
Cash only.

[Abou Tayssir](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MNNY17v67nSgrCZ16) - the Fattoush salad was amazing, the meat + rice dish of the day was ok
but I'd probably go with individual plates next time.
Fresh squeezed juice was good.
Prices were similar to other places.
No wifi, cash only.

[Alma Kitchen & Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9bD1hQnonnX2w3TZ8) - good but a bit expensive by local standards.

### Norway

#### Oslo

Nice to visit for a couple days,
but everything was closed and quiet at 4pm on a Sunday afternoon when I arrive,
very different to the hustle and bustle of London.

### Poland

One of my favourite countries.

I was very surprised how nice Poland was upon arriving, not just in one or two places either, but across the country's
major towns and cities.

- Low immigration
- Feels safer than the UK (supported by crime stats)
- Food is good and reasonably priced
- Airbnbs are expensive though
- Poland is not a cheap country any more
- Large country tht takens 6-8 hours to drive across
- Parking is often cheap or free after 8pm, which is great for going out to get dinner in the centres.
- Good and cheap Metro

#### Bydgoszcz

Historic town with lovely centre and plenty of good restaurants.

An excellent stopover choice when driving across Poland.

[Apteka Restauracja & Koktajlbar](https://restauracjaapteka.pl/menu/) is a recommended stop here for dinner and drinks.

#### Częstochowa

Not much there, dead if you're trying to use it for a late night stopover.

#### Gdansk

A large port city in the north of Poland.

Good restaurants and old town.

Not cheap. My Airbnb cost me more than in Dubai.

One of my colleagues is a contractor in Gdansk so gave me the local tour.

Taxis may rip you off if they hear you speak English.
He said you can get away without paying them if they don't put the meter on.
I don't know if this is true as I was driving so didn't try it.

He compared Uber like taxis apps when we went out.

Gdansk has ferry connections to Sweden.
There was zero border control coming off the ferry from Sweden to Gdansk, which surprised me.

[Slaska 19](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274725-d13810673-Reviews-Slaska_19-Gdansk_Pomerania_Province_Northern_Poland.html)
is a good restaurant away from the centre with an affordable weekday lunch menu and good wifi.

#### Katowice

Surprisingly busy city with large central communal areas and nightlife.

[Tatiana](https://www.restauracjatatiana.pl/) restaurant is recommended here.

[Alahamora - magiczna kawiarnia](https://alahamora.pl/) is a cafe treat for Harry Potter fans.
Unfortunately they have no wifi.

#### Krakow

Tourist hotspot.

*"F\*ck Warsaw, go to Krakow!"*, one of my Polish colleagues told me. He was right.

#### Łódź

Medium sized city, mall and restaurants, but lacks the historical centre attraction of other Polish cities.

#### Nowy Sącz

Nice small centre, good for a coffee stopover.

[Sofi Len Cafe](https://www.instagram.com/sofilen_kawiarnia) is recommended here.

#### Poznan

Historic town with lovely centre and plenty of good restaurants.

My first stopover in Poland when driving from Germany. I was pleasantly surprised how nice it was.

An excellent stopover choice when driving across Poland.

#### Sopot

The most expensive area in Poland, near Gdansk.

Good beaches, restaurants, and walkways.

#### Warsaw

Decent low pressure capital.

One of my colleagues moved back to Warsaw as a contractor.

Warsaw airport is deserted after 11pm as there were no night flights, it is better than many other airports but it is
not London Heathrow. This is also a big problem if you miss you transfer flight.

### Hungary

#### Avoid northern counties

Do not drive through the north Hungarian counties, there are serious ghettos that feel very unsafe:

Story here:

<https://medium.com/@harisekhon/the-revelation-of-why-hungary-is-so-anti-immigration-059259e51cf2>

#### Budapest

An excellent holiday destination for a long weekend with the girlfriend.

[Caviar & Bull](https://caviarandbull.hu/menu/) is an amazing dining experience to take the girlfriend if you're in the
mood to drop £300 on a fancy night out. The food is easily among the best I've ever haad around the world.

#### Szolnok

A modest town with a small centre to the east of the country.

A useful stopover point but there is not much to do there, don't spend more than a couple days there.

You will struggle to get fed once it hits 9pm as the kichens close much earlier than their, so make sure you dine earlier.

[Bajnok Étterem](http://uj.bajnoketterem.hu/) is the best place I ate at here, followed by
[New York café & bistro](https://www.newyorkbistro.hu/).
[OneBistro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fswF1W8nTAVzz9N97) is a late night cheap eat open until 10pm.

[Guri Sörbisztró](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100040639554637) is best late night drinking spot open until
midnight when everything else is dead. Try the pink tonic if you're non alcoholic.

[Korzó Kávéház](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RarMxm48ziz5TxMX9) is another drinks only place open until midnight.

[TiszapArt Café](https://tiszamozi.hu/) is open until 11pm, with good lemonades.

Despite it's 4.5 rating on Google, I was not impressed with the food,
either starter or main, at [Evezős Csárda](http://www.evezoscsarda.hu/Etlap.cshtml) and would give it a miss.

### Philipines

A very hot, mosquito-ridden country with overpopulated streets and wealth inequality,
which means a foreigner can live well with Western money.

Famed for its more traditional women,
many men known as *"Passport Bros"* go to find something more resembling wives than even married men in the West have.

There are a lot of missing signs, apparently because locals take them down and melt them for money.

#### Manilla

In the capital, the malls were relatively sparse since a lot of the poorer locals were kept out by security.

Kidnappings and random of the children of the rich are also a problem, with gated communities having their own security
forces.

### Serbia

I used the <https://www.airalo.com/> e-sim data only for $14 for 5GB valid for 30 days.

#### Indoor Smoking, Outdoor Smoking, Smoking Everywhere

It is still legal to smoke indoors in Serbia.

This really isn't the EU.

Unfortunately people seem to smoke a lot in Serbia.
I've changed tables while dinning outdoors at al fresco restaurants, only to have someone else then start smoking next
to me at another table.

I've moved indoor tables to escape from smokers,
and even cut short a coffee evening in frustration with people chain-smoking nearby due to getting fed up with all the
smoke inside the coffee shop.

You have to feel sorry for the Serbian wait staff subjected to second-hand smoke all day every day at work.

Quite shocking that Serbia permits this.

I've asked the locals about this and they said there are a couple non-smoking venues *"but nobody goes there"*.

#### Belgrade Taxis

[Car Go](https://appcargo.com/en) - like Uber. Didn't find any drivers, had to use Pink Taxi instead.

[Pink Taxi](https://pinktaxi.info/) has mixed reviews, but it worked.

Lux Taxi app couldn't even register using my UK mobile number - I got
[this error](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/harisekhon_imagine-having-a-top-taxi-app-in-belgrade-activity-7242252581597585409-MRlJ)
🤪

#### Driving in Serbia

Expect a 3 hour queues at the Serbian border.

I asked a guy in the queue of cars in front of me and he said 3-4 hours was common.

**IMPORTANT** - Make sure you have every document possible including your vehicle registration otherwise the Serbian police
will either refuse to let you in or blackmail you out money. Don't ask me how I know this.

See the [Driving Checklist](#driving-checklist) above.

I also saw several people pulled over by Serbian police.

Be wary of Serbian police. *"You are not in the EU now"* as they said to me.

Overall, a horrible experience driving to Serbia and I would not do it again.

You immediately feel like you've gone from Europe to some dangerous 3rd world country where you are more worried about
the police themselves and corruption.

#### Belgrade

The capital is reasonable in the center. Overall it is slightly cheaper to dine than other European cities.

The top end of the range is typically comparable to other european cities.

The lower end is typically about half that.

[Street Pasta Bar - Sremska](https://maps.app.goo.gl/woUhBnmt8973aEqH7) - is my top pick here - cheap, fresh juices,
good wifi and young crowd (probably due to it being cheap).
I've spent many hours on their wifi with regular top ups of juices and smoothies because they're so affordable,
on top of lunch and dinner.
Closes earlier than other restaurants at 9pm so it's better as a daytime place.
Non-smoking, a rare find in Belgrade.

[Elephant's Food House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aK24TL7T6c3cm3xKA) - another good cheap lunch type place.
Closes early at 6pm.

[Kafeterija Magazin 1907](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PwaZbmMLMU7zTr1Z6) -
good coffee shop with 2 levels right in the centre, often busy and open late until 11pm.

[Fit Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/S6nsPw9Ckj9v34Jg8) - small healthy eat place - one of the rare no smoking places in
Belgrade

[Burger House Bros Centar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C5FyhgFp16gPN11H9) - very good burger restaurant

[Boutique #2](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1svhc4v3bq3aAwfh7) - prime location restaurant for drinks or food on the main
parade, very popular and good

[Trattoria Pepe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gdP9dLWxAVzGYEdV6) - excellent Italian 5 minutes walk from the centre -
worth the walk

[Casa Nova](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mPPNKEYf2M5FKnm49) - has both outdoor and a non-smoking section on the upper level
rear section (quiet section, everybody in Belgrade seems to smoke)

[Velika Skadarlija](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jHfCipxrNiK4Bzg66) - good restaurant with great outdoor seating area, with
the odd plug if you need it

#### Novi Sad

Good central district of restaurants.

Cheaper Airbnbs as 1.5 hour drive from Belgrade.

[Petrus Caffe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1sZJoLAsLn5Vkq6m8) - excellent restaurant, very popular with large outdoor
seating area and excellent drinks menus, good for dining or drinks, open until midnight

[Kombinat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6Z2CV3UbhZTDLAaCA) - cool late night cafe open until 11pm

[Loft Downtown](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xQdXBJek5JBX17i49) - very popular cafe & restaurant with outdoor seating

[Bistro " Pastai"](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Vro8m7vM3eiKFzKn7) - a local cheap eat pasta place with good juices

### Slovakia

#### Kosice

Small city with a nice historic centre, but none of the venues I tried impressed me.

Would try [Slavia](https://www.kaviarenslavia.sk/jedalny-listok/) if I were to visit gain.

### South Africa

A dangerous high crime country due to high inequality (the Gini coefficient of inequality correlates to crime).

You will need a car in South Africa as its road infrastructure and distancing is similar to the US.

Make sure to lock your doors immediately to reduce risk of carjacking.

#### Johannesburg

Johannesburg, the capital, is where the biz is, where people cite Cape Town by the beach for leisure.

Houses have bars on their windows, barred gates with 2 dogs, and guns for good reason.
Violent home invasions are a common problem -
one of my colleauges in the UK emigrated from South Africa after a home invasion
where they pulled the gate off and invaded a mere 30 minutes after his family had left.
You may only get one close call like that in life.

Stick to the foreigner areas of Sandton and Rosebank. Seriously.

##### Sandton

Has a good mall, restaurants and hotels. The Da Vinci hotel is nice for example.

Nelson Mandela square should be relatively safe thanks to being surrounded by restaurants and mall with security.

##### Rosebank

Also has a mall and good restaurants.

Restaurants on the street outside the mall are patrolled by street security to ensure you make it back to your car.

### Sweden

Ferry from Tallinn in Estonia to Sweden and then another ferry down to Gdanks, Poland, is a way out if your license gets suspended for speeding in Latvia.

Police pulled me over coming off the ferry from Tallinn, Estonia,
and did a very invasive search of my car and all luggage, they opened everything, down to my toiletries and car bonnet.

Story here:

<https://medium.com/@harisekhon/the-police-attention-you-get-driving-a-drug-dealer-looking-car-through-europe-d38c5919835f>

#### Stockholm

The centre of Stockholm is ok for a day or two, probably not more. It's weirdly broken up into small island-like lands,
and lacks the impressive design and architecture of the central european capitals.
The girls are pretty of course.

The roads are not well designed and it's easy to take a wrong turn,
and parking in a problem in the centre, unlike Warsaw for example.

Do not stay in Kista. Mass immigrated and not one of the safest feeling places.
The Memory Hotel in Kista was cheap for a reason - it was absolutely dead in August like I have never seen before,
no staff most of the time or seeing other guests.

[Restaurang Kryp In](https://restaurangkrypin.se/) is good in the centre.

### Thailand

A fast life strategy place. Lots of tattoos and marijuana coffee shops.

#### Thailand Cash

You will need cash, big time. Thailand is cheap but lots of places do not take cards.

The ATM machines are thieves and will charge you £5 to withdraw almost any amount of cash,
so you may as well withdraw a larger sum so you can conned by them less often.

#### Thailand Mobile

I used True5G which has kiosks all over the airport.

You can get 30 days for around £27 or 180 days for around £30.

It works out slightly more expensive than Airalo but the latter one is the best price for such long durations and even beat my usual Airalo which is better for short term.

#### Thailand Taxis

[Grab](https://www.grab.com/) - taxi app

#### Bangkok

Khao San road is the place to be. It's buzzing even at midnight on a Sunday or Monday.

Plenty to eat and drink, with many foreigners partying.

Do not stay on Khao San itself or the noise will likely stop you sleeping as it is loud.

China Town is another good area with many restaurants and street food, but mostly shuts down by midnight.

##### Bankok Food

Mostly eat street food, it's way cheaper than restaurants which charge multiple times the prices.

- [The Fat Cow Yaowarat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KW3bgC8bSPGrXxT88) - gourmet burger restaurant, the Fat Cow burger was
  good, fries were a small portion though. This is expensive for local standards at £8 for a burger and fries, that's
  4x what you can eat street for for

#### Pattaya

Beach town.

##### Getting to Pattaya from Bangkok

Getting to Pattaya from Bangkok will cost you 1500-2000BHT
or you can just taxi to the bus station for 100-20BHT and then take a coach for 131 BHT,
but annoyingly they'll charge you an extra 40BHT for a large suitcase, and 20BHT for a small hand luggage sized suitcase
at boarding time.

### Turkey

Inflation and rent prices make this not a good value for money destination.

Expensive restaurants and there are only so many times you can eat kebab / mixed grill / dips.

#### Antalya Airport

I had a stopover and missed my connecting flight due to a 2 hour delay by the first flight.

Thw wifi in Antalya is even worse than in Istanbul. You need to swipe your passport at a kiosk to get a code for a
crappy minimal wifi, medium signal, but crippled bandwidth that web pages don't load. It was unusable on my laptop and
I had to rely on my Expedia app on my phone to eventually load enough for me to book a flight out of there.

This was the worst wifi experience I ever remember, even worse than Istanbul and Tbilisi.

The wifi was so terrible that after an hour of struggling to use it I ended up paying €6 for the
_"High Speed Internet"_, which was also unusable and kept cutting out.

#### Istanbul

Istanbul is one big tourist trap.

I am shocked how expensive Istanbul is, triply so arriving from Morocco.

Restaurants will often cost £30 per head without alcohol for food that would be cheaper even in the UK.

£6 for an orange juice when it was £1.50-£2 in Morocco the week earlier...
£2-4 for a water. Meanwhile in the supermarkets a fresh squeezed juice in a bottle is £1.50 or a 500ml water bottle for 10-20p.

The locals says it is because of the rent prices and that Antalya is even more expensive.

It hardly even matters which restaurant you go to, it's like they're all roughly price fixing rather than competing.

Google Maps reviews can't be trusted - almost everywhere seems to have 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, or 5.0 ratings for places that
would be 4.1 - 4.3 in the rest of the world.

You follow to a "recommended" place and find it even more overpriced than the others.
Either reviews are not factoring in price or there is a lot of fake review inflation in Istanbul.

The airport is, expectedly even worse.
£17 for a bolognese that would be £5-8 anywhere else, £20 for a burger etc.
The burgers look lowed grade compared to Gourmet Burger Kitchen back home.

Taxis are bad too.

One taxi driver quoted me "20 Euros" (not even their local currency) to go 1 mile down the road!

I asked 2 taxi drivers
to take me from Gayrettepe to Sultanahmet and they flat out refused in Turkish without speaking English.

I tried the [BiTaxi](https://www.bitaksi.com/en) app and it failed to find drivers for me several times,
even with tips pre-added.
I ended up walking the last mile to my accommodation.

I managed to get a taxi to the airport when leaving
but the taxi driver charged me 1000 on the BiTaxi app and then another 1700 on card in person.

### UAE

The United Arab Emirates is one of the most civilized and safe societies I have ever seen.

They have zero tolerance for criminals or welfares spongers.
They would literally deport half of the UK, which is why it's a nicer place.

#### Driving in UAE

Do not use Google Maps in Dubai, it is awful.

It will give you wrong directions or verbal instructions that do not match the map direction,
leading you to taking many wrong turns which can cost you half an hour in journey time as you try to navigate around
large blocks of motorways.

Use Waze instead.

#### Abu Dhabi

The capital of the UAE.

More relaxed, than Dubai.

##### Abu Dhabi Restaurants

- Paradiso - I dropped nearly £100 just for my half, but I did get the steak... good quality, the price of drinks adds up

#### Dubai

Dubai is more of a city-state than a city as Europeans would understand it.

It would be extremely difficult to walk due to the large distances and high heat.

*"I don't walk anywhere in Dubai"* one of my Brit guys there told me. I saw why after I arrived. Even a 15 minute walk
to lunch will leave you a sweaty mess by the time you get there.
People drive with air conditioning and dive into malls, offices and restaurants with air conditioning.

I used Virgin Mobile on a prepaid contract for around £200 for the year which was the cheapest deal I could find.

#### Dubai Metro

Good for the areas it covers.

Very cheap, typically 3 or 5 dirhams per for a single one-way journey using a prepaid Nol card
depending on if you're going 1 or 2 zones.
This works out to a mere 65p or £1.10!!

Buy a Nol card immediately for 25 dirhams which has 19 dirhams of credit already pre-loaded on it.

#### Dubai Taxis

You will need a car or taxi to really get around.

[Careem](https://www.careem.com/) is the everything app, including Taxis.

It does everything from Uber-style taxis, to food delivery, to rental bicycles.

#### Dubai Parking

Parking is easy in most of the malls but really difficult near the Dubai World Trade Center.

The [Al Saada parking](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hGDTeF9eKRzmPYV69) is a large free open air car park that is a gem known
only to the local workers.
Occasionally it is blocked off for DWTC events, but there is another smaller open air car park around the block
[here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jMzPUWreB5ypQ1gw9).
I avoid using the Al Mustaqbal car park as it is expensive at 10 AED per hour.

#### Dubai Weather

The weather is so hot even by May some people use sun umbrellas - so hot that it broke my car phone holder.
Rich people usually leave Dubai and go to Europe for the summer.
Copying them was how a lot of the European countries on this list were covered!

#### Dubai Attractions

Dubai has a good mix of beaches and malls.
It is built in the US style where a mall is not just a shopping venue but a destination with lots of restaurants & cafes
as well as activities.

- [Dubai Marina](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4NuAPJvdNj69mmqy5) - long walk with boats and restaurants -
  an excellent place to rent an e-scooter via Lime or bike via Careem since it's a 7km oval
- [JBR Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pR6TbPo8jbWeu7sM6) - popular tourist beach with the usual mix of restaurants
  and cafes
- [Downtown / Dubai Mall / Burj Khalifa area](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kdrUMenKN1bQd2tP8) - not just a mall,
  everything is here, countless restaurants and coffee shops (relatively expensive) and
  even indoor skating and aquarium with sharks and rays, the water fountains and surrounding area
- [Dubai Marina Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pAcde92GnfexCE2N8) - smaller mall on the Marina but high quality,
  everything from Wagamama to Waitrose to designer shops and good restaurants
- [Dubai Hill Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uwsPNDjDJjBystDi9) - large suburban mall with all the usual shops and
  restaurants
- [Mall of the Emirates](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qo3gmeqpzxHU8goj9) - popular mall with even indoor skiing,
  in the Al Barsha area which is mostly asian rather than western mix international like Dubai Mall or Dubai Marina Mall
- [Kite Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9s53Wg9S7vV7Rd8w5) - long popular beach with cafes for cool drinks, e-scooters,
  and hipster restaurants at the north end

#### Dubai Restaurants

Often restaurants outside of the malls are better in terms of prices.

- [Doors in Dubai Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9s53Wg9S7vV7Rd8w5) - fancy upmarket restaurant overlooking the
  Burj Khalifa water fountains. Go for a special occasion. You will pay £10 per juice
- [Tashas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rHzL2Sbo8uxodN3E9) - high quality restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating on the
  Dubai Marina
- [Moshi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xLCidAUmxFmP1XyT6) - small place with great asian food, Thai Tom Yum soup and Sushi,
  just outside the Mall of the Emirates
- [Acai Spot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ogJxLHpscsk4fVTBA) - chain Acai cafe throughout Dubai, pricey but good.
  I usually get the tropical or make your own
- [Angel Cakes Dubai Hills Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CJVaPFEXE9Xcs3CY8) - gentrified cafe serving food, cakes and
  drinks.
  Small chain, also available at Dubai Mall and Bluewaters (next to JBR)
- [Habib Beirut](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TdwLSXHzvYqwhKLe8) - good lebanese on the Marina, a short walk from
  Dubai Marina Mall
- [Alyasamin Aldimashqi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DtF6nwJy9mGDeVAh9) - good Syrian restaurant opposite Deira City Center Mall
- [Greenland](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NGURNp991VaCpFNR8) - local indian chain, 24x7, affordable,
  big selection of fresh juices
  There are outlets in various areas of Dubai
- [JusGrill](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9ia8SB2jGbaGxBU69) - local cheap eats in Al Rigga serving Indian, Chinese &
  Filipino food
  The Pancit Bihon (Filipino equivalent of singapore noodles) is good,
  as is the spicy Prawn Schezwan Fried Rice which contains lots of fresh green chillis.
  There is a large selection of fresh juices,
  but the Coconut Shake and Mango Passion Special are particularly good (I was getting one of these two daily)
- [Umami](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LcKVp4C6sZ72t1Nv6) - Japanese chain in the mall food courts, cheap and cheerful for
  a bento box, my pick if you're caught in a mall food caught with too much fast food
- [Favoreat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pJXGbtYvb6EPHU6A9) - outside City Center Deira Mall, it has an Ethiopian menu that
  is good with that special sour pancake thing they do with a variety of foods on it
- [Al Rigga Night Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dVxrrWQwxGW1KoNQ7) - full of cheap eats, and the market opposite,
  bustling at midnight, open until 2am

#### Dubai Visa

You are required to get a medical blood screening, chest x-ray, biometrics like fingerprinting to get a visa here.

Once you have residence you are no longer allowed to use your UK driver's license
and will get a shock as your car rental company refuses to release the car to you.

You will then need to Careem around the city to get your Emirates ID and then your Drivers License which will require
local bank or cash payment.

#### Dubai Banking

- [Mashreq](https://www.mashreq.com/) is the easiest to use, app-only like Starling or Monzo
  - I lost 5% on a GBP-to-GBP transfer from ADCB to Mashreq... Bitcoin transaction fees are
    [usually much lower](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee).
- [ADCB](https://www.adcb.com/en/personal/) is the next best, but the premium account is a big hassle and has a minimum balance requirement
  - See the 5% loss above sending GBP-to-GBP from ADCB to Mashreq (estimate 1.68% on ADCB's side even using a premium account)
  - I calculated a GBP to AED transfer within ADCB cost 1.66% hidden in a worse conversion rate. This is outrageous if
    you were to transfer or convert large amounts of money such as your life savings.
- [Emirates NBD](https://www.emiratesnbd.com/en) has a bad reputation among my peers for being a lot of hassle
  - they were a hassle to open, wanting salary certificate
  - even closing the account is difficult apparently
- [HSBC](https://www.hsbc.ae/) was a similar hassle to NBD above wanting salary certificate addressed specifically to them
  - much more hassle, not like HSBC back in the UK, most UK banks just open accounts easily
  - even already having an HSBC UK account doesn't help

### United Kingdom

See [The UK Decline - What I Learnt on UK Tour 2024](https://medium.com/@harisekhon/the-uk-decline-what-i-learnt-from-my-uk-tour-2024-84347efced9b).

### USA

You will get finger printed entering the country.

#### California

California, the once golden place is not what it used to be after doubling its population from mass immigration.

Weather is great though, restaurants are decent (London's restaurants are better though).

Many of these places are only places to go on company expense as the hotels will set you back quite a lot per night.

Americans are now fleeing the failing Democrat state for Texas, which will then become the next domino to fall.

##### Irvine

A nicer more suburban manufactured city than LA, with decent shops and restaurants.

##### Los Angeles

A giant square grid of blocks. From the plane it looks like The Matrix.

Hollywood boullivard is nothing fancy in the grand scheme of things.
It's just a tourist strip of a few restaurants and shops.

Rodeo Drive is the upmarket shopping road of expensive designer brands.

Beverley Hills are not as fancy as one would believe from Beverley Hills Cop movies.
More like a $1M+ middle class area.

[Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ](https://lucillesbbq.com/menu) is the best BBQ I've had in the entire world.
I've been searching for a BBQ place to match it across countries for over a decade now and nothing has come close.
The warm apple-cinnamon bun starters are amazing as are the giant beef ribs with the best BBQ glaze I've ever had.
My colleagues and I drove half way across LA to go to this because everybody knows it is the best.
If you're in LA or one of their expanded locations, do not miss it.
Looks like they now have a couple branches in Vegas and one in Phoenix, Arizona too.

[Crustacean](https://crustaceanbh.com/menu/) in Beverley Hills is a good upmarket seafood restaurant with fish in the
see-through floor as you enter. Impressive. Recommended if you want something a bit more upmarket.

##### Palo Alto

A tech hub town with serious tech millionaire money, as evidenced by things like the McLaren showroom.

It was the first place I ever recall seeing a Tesla in 2013. When the traffic lights turned green,
for a moment I thought our car wasn't even moving relative to seeing it take off and leaving us behind in our
Infinity Q37.

Quite nice area, if you can afford it.

##### San Diego

A somewhat more chill city than Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Restaurants were not that cheap though.

##### San Francisco

Too expensive for even most of my engineer colleagues at Cloudera to live in.

There were homeless people on every block in 2013 when I was there. It's apparently much worse now.

Beware if you walk just one block west of the central shopping district you'll end up on the road of Tenderloin
which is full of drug addicts in broad daylight.
Walking through a group of 4 drug addicts on the pavement is not a pleasant experience
even if you think you could take them.
Not recommended for women.

[Boudin](https://boudinbakery.com/) is a local chain famous for its sour dough bread and soup in bread bowls.
