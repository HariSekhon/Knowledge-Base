### Central & South America

Capital cities here are not the attraction, but more transit points - the attractions are usually the coasts, nature,
volcanos, or historic archaeological sites.

Has adopted the American tipping culture, so expect to add 10% service and often menus do not include taxes,
which can be another 12-17%, so factor in an additional 25% on any menu prices if you're budget conscious.

[Spanish Crash Course](travel/spanish.md) - you will need this for the following countries as most people do not speak English outside
of the hotels and more expensive tourist trap restaurants, even many taxi drivers who are used to many American tourists
surprisingly still do not speak English.

## Booking Sites

Always compare 2-3 sites as you might think one will always get you a better deal,
but once in a while it'll screw you with a much higher price than the others.

[Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com/) - discover how to get anywhere by plane, train, bus, ferry and car. Especially
useful if you're touring a region like Europe where things are not very far apart.

[Agoda.com](https://www.agoda.com/) - the best site for use in Asia, and you really need to go to Asia, it's amazing.

[HostelWorld.com](https://www.hostelworld.com/) - best for solo hostel travellers - sometimes more expensive than Agoda
for the same places, but sometimes has hostels that other sites don't have at all.
People are often willing to pay a slight premium to book through HostelWorld just to get access to it's unique city chat
feature to meet other solo travellers to socialize.
The chat is a bit sluggish and buggy, so I use this chat to collect the IGs and then start a better Insta group chat.
HostelWorld usually takes a deposit (which doesn't go to the hostel and is non-refundable if you cancel), and then you
pay the hostel when you arrive.
This means you are slightly better off booking a shorter time on the app to pay less deposit but still get access to
the city chat and then extending your stay locally with the hostel - as long as the hostel isn't likely to run out of
capacity!
There is a limitation in the app / website that you cannot change your booked duration once purchased,
and beware that if you cancel the booking (eg. because you want to shorten the duration for example at the request of
your hostel to free up the bed on their system) you will lose both your deposit and access to the chat, and the customer
service support cannot undo the cancellation for you either.

[Kayak.com](https://www.kayak.com/) - usually cheaper than SkyScanner and had cheaper flights not found on Expedia.
  lI prefer Kayak to SkyScanner because I can filter for flights including luggage in the price
  and when following through to [eDreams](https://www.edreams.com/) or [Trip.com](https://trip.com/) flights I can
  upgrade to 25kg luggage for ~£4, which is important because I got charged $30 for having 22kg checked luggage -
  2kg over the 20kg default luggage allowance of many airlines.
  Booking.com and Kiwi.com are bad for this only option of adding 20kg checked luggage

[SkyScanner.net](https://www.skyscanner.net/) - had cheaper flights that weren't even found on Expedia,
and cheaper on the same flights too

[Booking.com](https://www.booking.com) - cheaper and more hotels than Expedia, but sucks because it only allows you to add 20kg checked
luggage, which left me getting screwed for a $30 surcharge for being 2kg over on my checked luggage

[Expedia](https://expedia.co.uk) - LEGACY DO NOT USE.
Was my usual go to as it usually had the most options at the last minute, until SkyScanner and Kayak
showed it up.
Beware if you are trying
to get a hotel immediately for a missed flight the app will shunt the results to the next day
and you will end up booking the wrong night and then having a horrible battle trying to get it refunded.
Booking.com is better for that scenario.
Also, if you book the wrong date or there is any issue Expedia support are the worst ever.
You will struggle to get any refund.
Use them to find the hotels and flights,
then go book directly with the airline or hotel and deal with them directly if there is any problem.
You'll usually get a slight discount or other perk and when there is a problem you will not be stuck suffering Expedia
chat support.

[AirBnb](https://www.airbnb.com) - compare the cost of apartments to hotels in each area, it alternates which is
cheaper depending on the country.

[LastMinute.com](https://lastminute.com) - ok for package holidays but assumed return flights,
less good for a digital nomad who is going one way and bouncing to the next place.

[OnTheBeach.co.uk](https://www.onthebeach.co.uk/) - good prices but nothing available for same/next day for last minute
travellers like me.

## Travel Checklist

- Passport
- Visa
  - booked exit flight proof is required to enter some countries like Mexico
- Laptop (optional)
- Chargers - phone, laptop, electric toothbruth, USB-to-USB-c cable for plane
- Travel Adapters
- [Hostel Checklist](#hostel-tips) - padlock, towel, shower gel etc.
- Clothes for climate (check your weather app for the destination, it might be hotter / colder /
  rainier than you guess)

Optional:

- toiletries - you can buy toiletries almost anywhere, but you may prefer to take your favourite brands from home rather
  than make do with whatever you find there
- book or other entertainment for flight
- water bottle to refill after security takes your water off you

## Flights

Book ahead of time for better price comparisons.

Same goes for ferries if driving.

Favourite Airline: Air Arabia because they didn't tell me to put my laptop away during takeoff. One less pointless rule
enforced.

### Flight Booking Sites

Ranked by my success in finding affordable flights

- [Kayak.com](https://www.kayak.com/) - even cheaper than SkyScanner and had cheaper flights not found on Expedia
- [SkyScanner.net](https://www.skyscanner.net/) - had cheaper flights that weren't even found on Expedia, and cheaper on the same flights too
- [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com)
- [Agoda.com](https://www.agoda.com/) - better for hotels than flights
- [Expedia](https://expedia.co.uk) - fewer and more expensive flights
- [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/travel/flights)

### Flight Deals from the US

If you just want to go on hols and don't mind where, then you can use:

<https://www.going.com/>

Enter your nearest airport(s) and they will send you cheap deals to random destinations.

Unfortunately they do not serve airports outside the US at time of writing.

### Flight Gotchas

#### Return / Onwards Flights Required for Check-In

Some airlines / countries require proof of outbound flights,
and refuse to check you in or even luggage drop without it,
which can leave you scrambling to book an outbound flight from your destination country before the check-in closes.

This has hit me travelling to:

- [Mexico](travel/mexico.md) with Iberojet airline
- [Costa Rica](travel/costarica.md) with Avianca airline
- [Panama](travel/panama.md) with Copa airline
- [Colombia](travel/colombia.md) with Avianca airline
- [Bolivia](travel/bolivia.md) with Aviana airline

In [Panama](travel/panama.md) and [Costa Rica](travel/costarica.md)
the immigration officer did ask for my outbound flight and accommodation,
whereas in [Mexico](travel/mexico.md), [Colombia](travel/colombia.md) and [Bolivia](travel/bolivia.md)
they asked for my accommodation details but not my outbound flight.

Regardless, the airlines will not let you check-in without an outbound flight when travelling to some countries.

Check the country's immigration rules ahead of time and get to the airline at least 3-4 hours
before take off to give yourself 30-60 minutes to scour and book outbound / onwards flights if you need to.

Technically it could be outbound bus to a nearby country,
or you could book a flexible flight that you could change the date later
as it can be quite disruptive to force travel plans to specific dates when you don't know how long you want to explore
a country
(I've stayed longer than intended in several countries due to finding recommended holiday towns, seas, volcanos etc).

#### Luggage

Be careful with your luggage weight. I got charged $30 in Asia for being 2kg overweight.

It is usually much cheaper to just book a larger luggage weight in advance, such as 25kg instead of 20kg.

If doing short trips, you might be better off not taking checked luggage at all as budget airlines like Whizz Air charge
you a lot extra on top of the initial flight cost to have a checked luggage, and if only going somewhere for 2-3 days
you really only need a change of clothes and minimal toiletries.

The real problem is if you have lots of toiletries for skincare routines etc,
as it can be hard to get it through the airport security and need that checked luggage.

If going away for longer, such as travelling South America, then ditch the carry-on luggage as they often charge a
similar amount extra for it as for checked luggage, and just putting everything in one large checked-in suitcase works
out cheaper.

#### Transfer Flight Timings

**Do not take transfer flights with less than 3-4 hours between them.**

It is common for the first flight to be delayed by 1.5 hours
and then you don't have enough time to catch the second flight.
Even more so if you have to go through security again which can delay you by another 30-60 minutes.

I have gotten stranded overnight in Warsaw like this on the way from London to Tbilisi, with no replacement flight for
24 hours.
And of course there is no hotel availability at 11:30pm except for £200-300+ per night hotels.

#### Self Transfer

Avoid `Self Transfer`.

This is a hack by comparison sites matching unrelated airline flights.

If the first flight is delayed, which is common, the other airline won't care or wait for you.

You will lose the second flight you paid for.
They try to sell you additional insurance in this case to potentially offer you another
flight but who's to say that will be the next decent flight instead of the cheapest possible.

This is how you can get stranded at airports for awfully long periods of time wearing you down.

I've learnt this one the hard way when my flight from Tbilisi, Georgia, to Antalya, Turkey, was delayed by 1hr30mins
so I had no chance of catching the other flight which was only 2 hours apart.
Worse still it was at another terminal
that was 2km away so I even had to take a taxi to the other terminal for the other flight.

You will also lose time collecting luggage, going through a new check-in, security again etc.

Stick to the same airline transfers, they will be aware that their counterpart flight was delayed
and are more likely to hold the flight to give everyone time to transfer.

#### Change Airport

Beware there is no `CHANGE AIRPORT` stopover as you'd have to travel between airports across a city or region
and this makes it even more likely that you'll miss a connecting flight.

It's even worse than the `Self Transfer`.

#### Charging Your Devices on Flights

Many planes have been around for a long time such that they only have classic old large USB ports to charge devices,
whereas most modern smartphones and laptops have USB charging ports.

Bring a USB-to-USB-c charging cable of at least medium length
to be able to charge your smartphone - medium length to be able for it to reach to the pouch on the back of the seat in
front of you where you may want to rest your phone.

## Accommodation - Hotels vs Hostels vs Airbnb

This is usually one of the biggest travel expenses,
so check in advance and avoid places with high accommodation costs, or shorten your stays there.

After a lot of travelling, I have come to the conclusion that you can judge a place by the cost of its accommodation.

In Croatia for example, you can pay £30-50 per night for hostel,
which is ridiculous as you could stay in a full private hotel room in Dubai for £55.

If a place has expensive accommodation, either consider travelling to somewhere else better value if holidaying,
or shorten your trip there and then go somewhere better value for longer.

**If you're travelling alone, don't waste your time & money on Hotels or Airbnbs, use hostels, they're more social and**
**1/3 of the price.
Save your money and spend it on good food in restaurants instead.
Hostels have lockers for your valuables like laptops (you may want to take your own stronger padlock).**

Hotels and [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com) vary as to which one is cheaper by location.

Check both.

The earlier you book the better deals you'll get.

Unlike restaurants where the food and prices are consistent,
hotels prices and availability fluctuate wildly, so I don't believe in trying for specific hotels -
search and see what is good at that time.

I have on many occasions booked accommodation in the airport lounge minutes before boarding planes
but I do not recommend this.
I have have private hosts cancel my accommodations the day before or even the same day of my arrival
(see [Morocco](#morocco)).

It's annoying to be booking at the last minute because you'll get the least good places for the most expensive prices.

### Internet - Hotel vs Airbnb

Hotel wifi is probably the worst wifi ever,
often averaging around 10Mbit/s, sometimes 7Mbit/s, I've even recorded it as low at 2Mbit/s,
and they tend to have frequent random outages.

The slow speeds - especially throughput and latency variability - can ruin even your audio conference calls, never mind
your video conference calls, especially if you are forced to do them through a corporate Windows Virtual Desktop which
is far more network expensive and latency sensitive.

I have been bitten by this several times.

If Digital Nomadding, try to get out to a cafe with good internet for conference calls, and test their speeds (see the
doc [Network - Speed Test](networking.md#network-speed-test)).
If it's less than 20Mbit/s, find somewhere else.
I've observed good places having wifi speeds of even 70-90Mbit/s and almost no contention due to low number of users.

Internet in Airbnb is either good high speed broadband or broken entirely for the duration.

At one hotel in Thailand, the room wifi was broken the entire week I was there.
I had to sit in the lobby to use the wifi network there, as did others,
and sometimes even that didn't work due to having run out of IP addresses from their DHCP address pool -
a trivial problem to fix if they had even an average IT engineer on hand or over the phone.
I spent all week hassling the reception staff daily pleading to put one on the phone for me to tell them how to fix
it without success).
It still wasn't working when I left there.

Hostels tend to be nearer the hotel end of the wifi internet spectrum, but not usually as bad as hotels in my experience
as the younger crowd of hostels is much more internet dependent and they know this.

### Parking - Hotel, Hostel & Airbnb

If driving, make sure to double check parking at hotels or Airbnbs.

If Expedia shows `Parking Available` include of `Parking Included`, that means there will be parking charges,
which can be quite high.

You have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the hotel listing to find out what the charges are in the small print.

When driving, I often prefer booking places a bit away from the centers to get easier parking as many central
accomodations, both hotels and airbnbs lack good parking.

Also, if you're only going into the centres in the evenings, often you can get cheap or even free parking.

Hostels are usually more central and have no parking, so that's an extra challenge to find external parking locations if
driving, such as my European Summer Road Trip Tours.

### Hostel Tips

#### Lockers

Hostels usually have lockers for valuables (check thel listing before booking).

Some have lockers with a key, others expect you to have a padlock (which they can usually rent to you).

If using hostels repeatedly, get yourself a padlock with a key rather than combination lock,
because aside from the fact someone can just spend a few hours to try all combinations, when you're putting stuff away
late at night, it's must easier with a key than trying to do a combination in the dark with your phone light.

#### Towels

Some hostels provide towels, others rent them to you, and others don't provide them at all.

If using hostels repeatedly,
buy yourself a nice fluffy towel with a high thread count instead of renting them,
it'll work out cheaper in the long run anyway.

#### Shower Gel

At most hostels you will need to take your own shower gel.

#### Pillows

Pillows tend to not be great in hostels.

So in Europe where I road trip, which gives me greater flexibility and luggage capacity, I take my 2 memory foam
pillows.

One could make do with taking one good pillow, but if flying even this might take up valuable space and weight in your
checked luggage suitcase.

#### WorldPackers

You can use [WorldPackers](https://www.worldpackers.com/) to volunteer at hostels in exchange for free board,
which is a great way of seeing the world when young on budget.

## Taxis

Airport taxis are a rip off all over the world. Do not use them.

Use the taxi apps for the specific country,
as each country has a different selection of apps that work there,
which are listed on each country's page.

Compare the different apps to get the best price, it only takes 2 minutes.

Among taxi apps InDrive is generally cheaper than Uber although often requires that you pay in cash.

Taxis in some countries only accept cash anyway,
even when ordering them using apps, such as in Albania,
or the airport taxis in Moldova and Malaysia.

Taxis in Thailand and Malaysia have stopped at ATMs to get me to withdraw cash for them.

See the [ATM and Foreign Cash Withdrawals](#atms-and-foreign-cash-withdrawals) section below.

## Wifi

### Wifi Hotels

Hotel wifi is often awful, in both signal reliability and speed, even at relatively nice hotels.

### Wifi Cafes & Restaurants

Preserve your mobile data and battery life by not using 4G/5G except when you have to,
always get on the cafe / restaurant wifi.

### Wifi Speeds

I have listed wifi speeds at various venues I've used to digital nomad around as I live on wifi.

_"X/Y Mbit wifi"_ shorthand means X Mbit/s download and Y Mbit/s upload eg.
50/30 means 50 Mbit/s download speed and 30Mbit/s upload speed, as tested using
[network speed test](networking.md#speedtestnet).

## Mobile Internet Access

Always ensure you have mobile internet before you leave the airport or cross the border by car / coach.

Use the airport wifi to set up one of your e-sims using the lists below, or sims at the airports.

On rare occasion I wasn't able to get airport wifi working, and that could be a problem so it's better to sort the e-sim
on the wifi of your departing airport before you take off than arrive at the other end.

### EU Roaming

If you're not an EU resident or don't have an EU sim, skip to the next section [Mobile e-Sims](#mobile-e-sims).

I've used my UK sim from [Smarty](https://smarty.co.uk) across all the EU countries I visited as it permits use of your
plan's bundled service within EU countries at no extra charge, and the monthly contract is cheap as chips.

Now that is progress!

- included calls
- included texts
- up to 12GB of your data plan
  - I actually increased my data plan because I used it for GPS everywhere, and didn't want
    to risk running out

There is a tweak you need to make to your phone to enable it for roaming:

<https://smarty.co.uk/roaming-setup>

which basically comes down to changing your Mobile Service data MMS APN to `mob.asm.net` in your phone settings.

My UK phone number worked across all European countries I travelled through, including:

- Austria

It stopped working when I got to Serbia which is not in the EU.

Going from EU to non-EU was a bit of a jarring experience.

There may be something to the EU integration project after all.

### Mobile e-Sims

You can buy data plans for a certain number of days.

Follow the installation instructions and make sure to enable `Data Roaming`
under the e-sim settings otherwise the internet won't connect.

Prices fluctuate and alternate by country so compare the top 3 providers before choosing:

- [Nomad](https://www.getnomad.app/) - a bit cheaper than Airalo,, I've started using this the most
- [Airalo](https://www.airalo.com/) - I used this a lot originally, second cheapest option
- [Saily](https://saily.com/) - if the price is the same I prefer this one because you don't have to install a new e-Sim each time but
  can actually just add data for a new country to your already loaded e-Sim.
  My travel buddy who also travels all year has had issues with Saily, finding it to be
  be unreliable and had to get refunds from them 3 times across different countries, but it worked ok for me, and
  I've had such issues with the other providers...
- [AloSim](https://alosim.com/) - took a punt and used this for Bosnia as it was the cheapest there

Others:

- [Eskimo](https://www.eskimo.travel/en) - global data plans so you don't lose your remainder and can use it in other
  countries, but in my experience the price per GB is so much more experience that this isn't worth it
- [Holafly](https://esim.holafly.com/) - offers unlimited data but very expensive, usually not worth it given you typically don't use more
  than 1-3GB unless you're watching lots of videos on 4G instead of hotel wifi

Not tried these:

- [sSim.sm](https://esim.sm/)
- [Gjirafa eSIM](https://travel.gjirafa.com/en/esim)

<!-- -->

- [Fonus](https://www.fonusmobile.com/) - unlimited worldwide mobile plans

<!-- -->

- [Silent.link](https://silent.link) - Pay-as-You-Go prepaid, anonymous (no KYC, no name or even email),
  pay in [Bitcoin](bitcoin.md) or other [Crypto](crypto.md), account balance doesn't expire,
  but the per GB data rates are higher, priced in USD, and can vary quite substantially even within the same country eg.
  in Thailand it may be \$1.32 on a couple networks and then over \$7 on the True Thailand network.
  The e-sims above usually work out cheaper.
  Get Silent Link as a backup non-expiring balance in case the airport wifi doesn't work to get your e-sim above set up
  or the e-sim loses reception provider and you need GPS for navigation or emergencies

Google [travel e-sims](https://www.google.com/search?q=travel+e-sims)
and add the country you are travelling to for more options.

### Conserve Mobile Data - Pre-Download Offline Google Maps, Translate & Spotify Playlists

Most of my data usage was caused by Google Maps and Spotify
(you can see this on iPhone under `Settings` -> `Mobile Service` further down the page).

Pre-cache your usage when on Wifi to avoid using up too much precious mobile e-sim data:

- Google Maps - download an offline map for your city or area under settings -  you need to keep Google Maps open until
  the download is complete
- Spotify - click the downloaded option on your playlists - by default this will only download on wifi
- Google Translate - download the language (the icon to the left of each language on the language selection drop down)

Give each time to complete and check their progress before setting out and leaving your wifi connection behind.

### International Calls using VoIP over the Internet

Because banks and other legacy providers will force you to call them, you can use one of these services:

- [Viber](https://account.viber.com/en/call-united-kingdom) - 1 week free trial, £5.99 afterwards for unlimited calls (or £1.79 for 100 mins a month),
  but again does not apply to premium or non-geographic numbers like banks often use,
  worked on Barclays number that MoreMins was not processing voice
- [MoreMins](https://www.moremins.com/) - quick, cheap and easy, has an app, £5 for 30 days of unlimited calls,
  use 0800 number to your bank, as premium / national numbers like banks are often using will incur high per-minute
  charges. Blocked me from using Barclays 0800 number. Possible bust option
- [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com/rates) - cheaper than Skype for national calls but hard to use as a foreigner,
  limited to 10 countries, need to use a [VPN](vpn.md) just to try to access it, disappointing usability
- [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/international-calls/) - £5 for 400 minutes, expensive for national numbers like most
  banks and businesses use

## ATMs and Foreign Cash Withdrawals

ATMs in some countries charge a flat fee of between £5-7 for any withdrawal amount -
Thailand, Cambodia, Croatia and Albania spring to mind.

This means it's better to estimate how much you need up front and make fewer larger withdrawals.

Do not use your Wise card to withdraw cash from ATM machines overseas - they charged me almost \$7 as an
_'ATM withdrawal fee'_... on top of the \$5 the Cambodian ATM charged me.

My bank by comparison charged me only the exchange rate, which was very close to accurate, I checked.

Obviously don't withdraw cash using credit cards, they'll likely have the worst / highest unscrupulous charges.

## Restaurants & Dining Out

Use [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com) (see [Mobile Internet Access](#mobile-internet-access) section).

Filter by:

- `Top Rated` on phone or `4.5+` Star rating on desktop
- Distance
- Price eg. `£, ££` or `£££` if it's date night
- Prefer restaurants with higher number of reviews to reduce likelihood of fake reviews swaying / gaming the system
- Places with soft piano music are upmarket (expensive)

Places just outside the centres are often better value for money and top quality food,
but some central places are great too.

Restaurants that close earlier are usually better foodie places, often with more reasonable prices. You'll often pay a
premium for places that are open later, because there are less rival choices open at that time.

Do not look at the menu pictures from 2+ years ago because the prices will be wrong with all the government inflationary
money printing of fiat currency and you will get a surprise when you get there.

I leave a couple recommendations in each location on the country specific pages.

Some places don't have English menus -
these are often the best places that aren't so spoilt by foreign money and tourist trap
churn allowing them to lower their standards.

You will need to use a [Translation App](#translation) ...

## Translation

If travelling to a non-English speaking country, I recommend downloading the
[Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/about/) app:

- Translates typed words
- Translates spoken words into typed words and immediately translates them
- Translates pictures replacing words into another language
  - uses Google Lens [AI](ai.md)
- Large list of supported languages
- Optional: download language support when on wifi
  - didn't notice this making much impact on my data plan either way

## Seasons - Timing Matters

Don't bother with Europe outside of June to August,
the weather is miserable 9 months out of the year and still awful even in late May, supposedly end of Spring,
as well as by September.

## Mosquito Repellent

Buy a good mosquito repellent if you're travelling anywhere near the Mediterranean, Asia or Africa -
I even got eaten in Belgium in summer time!

I find that cream works better than spray.

It is no fun being itchy all the time because these little bastards are biting you every day and night and leaving
lumps all over you.

And you can't feel them land to catch them and can never seem to kill enough of them.

You *need* mosquito repellent. Don't miss it.

## Health Insurance

Not used these personally yet.

## Beware Foreign Police & Customs

You may not understand how despicable institutional corruption is until you've had a first hand run-in with it.

I have been shaken down, fined or blackmailed by Police in countries ranging from South Africa to Latvia to Serbia,
had an
[invasive car search in Sweden](https://medium.com/@harisekhon/the-police-attention-you-get-driving-a-drug-dealer-looking-car-through-europe-d38c5919835f),
and was randomly stopped and questioned a couple times by the UK police on occasions I wore a hoodie
(with hood down during peak daytime 9am-2pm walking along the pavement slowly in broad daylight, not hiding my face).

<!-- TODO: link to medium article on random stop and search experiences -->

**Do not give the police any excuse to stop you.**

### Carry Your Official Documents Everywhere For When You _Are_ Stopped

Carry all of your documents on you safely in case you are stopped
(see [Driving](#driving) section checklist).

### Don't Speed

See the [Driving](#driving) section for more on this.

### Do Not Even Jaywalk

Do not walk across road crossings during red men pedestrian traffic signs as some countries have laws against
_"jay walking"_
which the police may choose
to only enforce against you as a foreigner etc. Some Police wait at major traffic light crossing
waiting for gullible foreigners to make this fineable mistake.

![Dont_trust_the_police](images/dont_need_gun_police_will_protect_you_thought_you_didnt_trust_police.jpeg)

**ps. don't carry guns to other countries! You will almost certainly get put in jail !!**

**pps. Don't even carry tools or anything remotely sharp.
I've even had my shaving razors taken off me at airports -
you never know how they will treat you in a foreign place and it varies significantly.**

## Driving

Ferries are surprisingly expensive, similar or more in price compared a plane ticket.

This probably works out a little more economical if having more than one person in the car.

You should book ahead of time due to limited slots, and for better pricing.

EU countries have town symbols along routes which automatically drop the speed limit to 50kmph whether they declare it
explicitly or not.

This is a local knowledge that will get you done and your license revoked if you hit 100kmph. See [Latvia](#latvia).

### Car Insurance

Car insurance often includes 30-90 days cover in Europe, check each provider for details.

**Beware: UK car insurance covers only EU countries and one or two others like Switzerland and Serbia, but NOT**
**Montenegro, Albania or North Macedonia.**

Not coincidentally these are 3 out of the 4 non-EU countries left in the Balkans
and for good reason as they are clearly the least developed countries.

**You will be forced by the police to buy expensive insurance at the border in those countries if you cannot prove you**
**have a specific insurance covering their country.**

### International Driving Insurance

- [Lobagola](https://www.lobagola-insurance.com/)
  - [Lobagola Balkans](https://www.lobagola-insurance.com/insurance/balkans.html)

#### Temporary Car Insurance Cover

These are relatively very expensive in my experience so I avoid them.

- [GoShorty](https://goshorty.co.uk/temporary-car-insurance/european-car-insurance/) - extremely expensive, £30-36 for
  3 hours!
- [TempCover](https://motor.tempcover.com/) - expensive, quoted me £273 for just 28 days
- [DayInsure](https://www.dayinsure.com/)

### Driving Checklist

Police may refuse you entry or blackmail you out of money if you don't have all of the following documents:

- Passport:
  - South African police laid a trap pulling over foreigners coming out of
    [Sandton](#sandton) - primarily a rich foreigner area.
    My guess is they were targeting rental cars in an attempt to extort fines / bribes from foreigners not carrying
    their passports and even document imaginable including driving license and international driver's permit.
    <!-- TODO: medium story this full exchange -->
- UK driver's license
- International driver's permit (get this from the Post Office it's only around £5 but requires a passport photo)
- Insurance certificate
  - check it covers the specific country, see note above that non-EU countries are often not covered
- Vehicle Registration V5C paper proof of ownership
  - [Serbian](#serbia) police refused to accept digital proof of ownership via insurance certificate
  - they insisted on physical original paper copy
  - they said it was the equivalent to *"Passport for the car"*

### Additional EU Driving Checklist

Driving in the EU additionally requires:

- breakdown kit (AA does one), including:
  - high viz jacket (which must be available in the passenger compartment
  - breakdown triangle
  - headlamp converters

Headlamp converters are basically headlamp stickers that change the glare direction of your headlamps to shine the other
way because you drive on the right in Europe instead of the left like in the UK.

Apparently the French police are likely to pull you over and fine you if you don't have these.

### EU Motorway Tolls

Socialist Europeans find extra ways to tax you
and you need to buy motorway passes when driving in several European countries or face fines.

There are automated cameras so you are likely to get hit with fines if you don't buy one of these in advance.

See here for some details of which countries and prices.

<https://www.autoeurope.com/travel-tips/vignette-stickers/>

Specific countries purchase apps and websites are listed under each country.

### Do Not Speed

Do not speed, you only need to go a meagre 50kmh above the speed limit and the [Latvian](#latvia) police will revoke
your license.

This is easy to do in towns which are set to only 50kmph speed limits whether they explicitly declare it or not.

If you see a car pushing into the back of you, do not speed up.

It may be a police car that will only put on its siren after you've increased speed to breach the +50kmph maximum
penalty of €360 euros and a revoked license.

The extended time pulled over by the police not knowing if they are going to arrest you and impound your vehicle on top
of revoking your license will set you back a lot more time than any speed up would give you.

It's quite possible they do this on purpose 15 minutes from the Estonia border to catch unsuspecting foreigners driving
between the countries.

Let cars overtake you than fall for this unmarked police car entrapment.

### Parking

Use [Parkopedia](https://www.parkopedia.com/) to find parking and see its pricing up front to not get ripped off.
Occasionally the parking might be slightly more expensive than Parkopedia's latest knowledge.

There are apps for Parkopedia for iPhone and Android.

In the Parkopedia app, once you've selected the car park you can, share it to Waze to plan the journey there.

Do not use Waze to get to the city and then try to find parking, that's more difficult, and Waze will often send you to
some random part of a city, which has little there.

## Travel Days Planning

### Spreadsheet to Auto-Recalculate Dates

If you want to see how to create a spreadsheet to auto-recalculate your travel dates from just the number of days
you want to spend there, see the [Spreadsheets](spreadsheets.md#auto-calculate-dates) page which has section explaining
how to do this.

This is super useful to:

- track how many days you intend to stay in each place
- track your dates to book flights and accommodation for
- sum the days per country or region such as EU Schengen for visa purposes (tourist visa doesn't reset across EU
  countries!)

### Digital Nomadding

See also [Nomads.com](https://nomads.com/@harisekon) which has some overlap with the spreadsheet above as described in
the [Remote Working & Digital Nomad](remote-working.md#digital-nomad) digital nomad section.

### EU Schengen Visa Calculator

The following basic EU visa days calculator sites are also useful, in addition to the above spreadsheet.

This one is easy to use as you just have to click your entry / exit dates:

<https://schengenareacalculator.com/>

This one is less easy to use because you have to manually enter the dates:

<https://www.visa-calculator.com/>

## Emigration

### Taxes

Brits leaving in the middle of a UK tax year (April 6th - April 5th next year) will have a declare a split tax year to
HMRC.

It's best to plan ahead and leave just before April 5th to not contaminate another next tax year with HMRC able to claim
tax off you that quite frankly the UK doesn't deserve at this point.

[Tax Advice for Emigrating or Going Digital Nomad](https://medium.com/@harisekhon/tax-advice-for-emigrating-or-going-digital-nomad-c100fba461ed)

### Mail Redirection

Brits may want to [redirect their mail overseas](https://www.postoffice.co.uk/mail/redirection) or
get a [PO Box](https://www.royalmail.com/receiving/po-box) to collect on return visits.
