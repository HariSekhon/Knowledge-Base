## Booking Sites

Always compare 2-3 sites as you might think one will always get you a better deal,
but once in a while it'll screw you with a much higher price than the others.

[Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com/) - discover how to get anywhere by plane, train, bus, ferry and car. Especially
useful if you're touring a region like Europe where things are not very far apart.

[Agoda.com](https://www.agoda.com/) - the best site for use in Asia, and you really need to go to Asia, it's amazing.

[HostelWorld.com](https://www.hostelworld.com/) - best for solo hostel travellers - sometimes more expensive than Agoda
for the same places, but sometimes has hostels that other sites don't have at all.
People are often willing to pay a slight premium to book through HostelWorld just to get access to it's unique city chat
feature to meet other solo travellers to socialize.
The chat is a bit sluggish and buggy, so I use this chat to collect the IGs and then start a better Insta group chat.
HostelWorld usually takes a deposit (which doesn't go to the hostel and is non-refundable if you cancel), and then you
pay the hostel when you arrive.
This means you are slightly better off booking a shorter time on the app to pay less deposit but still get access to
the city chat and then extending your stay locally with the hostel - as long as the hostel isn't likely to run out of
capacity!
There is a limitation in the app / website that you cannot change your booked duration once purchased,
and beware that if you cancel the booking (eg. because you want to shorten the duration for example at the request of
your hostel to free up the bed on their system) you will lose both your deposit and access to the chat, and the customer
service support cannot undo the cancellation for you either.

[Kayak.com](https://www.kayak.com/) - usually cheaper than SkyScanner and had cheaper flights not found on Expedia.
  lI prefer Kayak to SkyScanner because I can filter for flights including luggage in the price
  and when following through to [eDreams](https://www.edreams.com/) or [Trip.com](https://trip.com/) flights I can
  upgrade to 25kg luggage for ~£4, which is important because I got charged $30 for having 22kg checked luggage -
  2kg over the 20kg default luggage allowance of many airlines.
  Booking.com and Kiwi.com are bad for this only option of adding 20kg checked luggage

[SkyScanner.net](https://www.skyscanner.net/) - had cheaper flights that weren't even found on Expedia,
and cheaper on the same flights too

[Booking.com](https://www.booking.com) - cheaper and more hotels than Expedia, but sucks because it only allows you to add 20kg checked
luggage, which left me getting screwed for a $30 surcharge for being 2kg over on my checked luggage

[Expedia](https://expedia.co.uk) - LEGACY DO NOT USE.
Was my usual go to as it usually had the most options at the last minute, until SkyScanner and Kayak
showed it up.
Beware if you are trying
to get a hotel immediately for a missed flight the app will shunt the results to the next day
and you will end up booking the wrong night and then having a horrible battle trying to get it refunded.
Booking.com is better for that scenario.
Also, if you book the wrong date or there is any issue Expedia support are the worst ever.
You will struggle to get any refund.
Use them to find the hotels and flights,
then go book directly with the airline or hotel and deal with them directly if there is any problem.
You'll usually get a slight discount or other perk and when there is a problem you will not be stuck suffering Expedia
chat support.

[AirBnb](https://www.airbnb.com) - compare the cost of apartments to hotels in each area, it alternates which is
cheaper depending on the country.

[LastMinute.com](https://lastminute.com) - ok for package holidays but assumed return flights,
less good for a digital nomad who is going one way and bouncing to the next place.

[OnTheBeach.co.uk](https://www.onthebeach.co.uk/) - good prices but nothing available for same/next day for last minute
travellers like me.

## Flights

Book ahead of time for better price comparisons.

Same goes for ferries if driving.

Favourite Airline: Air Arabia because they didn't tell me to put my laptop away during takeoff. One less pointless rule
enforced.

### Flight Booking Sites

Ranked by my success in finding affordable flights

- [Kayak.com](https://www.kayak.com/) - even cheaper than SkyScanner and had cheaper flights not found on Expedia
- [SkyScanner.net](https://www.skyscanner.net/) - had cheaper flights that weren't even found on Expedia, and cheaper on the same flights too
- [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com)
- [Agoda.com](https://www.agoda.com/) - better for hotels than flights
- [Expedia](https://expedia.co.uk) - fewer and more expensive flights
- [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/travel/flights)

### Flight Deals from the US

If you just want to go on hols and don't mind where, then you can use:

<https://www.going.com/>

Enter your nearest airport(s) and they will send you cheap deals to random destinations.

Unfortunately they do not serve airports outside the US at time of writing.

### Flight Gotchas

#### Luggage

Be careful with your luggage weight. I got charged $30 in Asia for being 2kg overweight.

It is usually much cheaper to just book a larger luggage weight in advance, such as 25kg instead of 20kg.

If doing short trips, you might be better off not taking checked luggage at all as budget airlines like Whizz Air charge
you a lot extra on top of the initial flight cost to have a checked luggage, and if only going somewhere for 2-3 days
you really only need a change of clothes and minimal toiletries.

The real problem is if you have lots of toiletries for skincare routines etc,
as it can be hard to get it through the airport security and need that checked luggage.

#### Transfer Flight Timings

**Do not take transfer flights with less than 3-4 hours between them.**

It is common for the first flight to be delayed by 1.5 hours
and then you don't have enough time to catch the second flight.
Even more so if you have to go through security again which can delay you by another 30-60 minutes.

I have gotten stranded overnight in Warsaw like this on the way from London to Tbilisi, with no replacement flight for
24 hours.
And of course there is no hotel availability at 11:30pm except for £200-300+ per night hotels.

#### Self Transfer

Avoid `Self Transfer`.

This is a hack by comparison sites matching unrelated airline flights.

If the first flight is delayed, which is common, the other airline won't care or wait for you.

You will lose the second flight you paid for.
They try to sell you additional insurance in this case to potentially offer you another
flight but who's to say that will be the next decent flight instead of the cheapest possible.

This is how you can get stranded at airports for awfully long periods of time wearing you down.

I've learnt this one the hard way when my flight from Tbilisi, Georgia, to Antalya, Turkey, was delayed by 1hr30mins
so I had no chance of catching the other flight which was only 2 hours apart.
Worse still it was at another terminal
that was 2km away so I even had to take a taxi to the other terminal for the other flight.

You will also lose time collecting luggage, going through a new check-in, security again etc.

Stick to the same airline transfers, they will be aware that their counterpart flight was delayed
and are more likely to hold the flight to give everyone time to transfer.

#### Change Airport

Beware there is no `CHANGE AIRPORT` stopover as you'd have to travel between airports across a city or region
and this makes it even more likely that you'll miss a connecting flight.

It's even worse than the `Self Transfer`.

## Hotels vs Hostels vs Airbnb

After a lot of travelling, I have come to the conclusion that you can judge a place by the cost of its accommodation.

In Croatia for example, you can pay £30-50 per night for hostel,
which is ridiculous as you could stay in a full private hotel room in Dubai for £55.

If a place has expensive accommodation, either consider travelling to somewhere else better value if holidaying,
or shorten your trip there and then go somewhere better value for longer.

**If you're travelling alone, don't waste your time & money on Hotels or Airbnbs, use hostels, they're more social and**
**1/3 of the price.
Save your money and spend it on good food in restaurants instead.
Hostels have lockers for your valuables like laptops (you may want to take your own stronger padlock).**

Hotels and [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com) vary as to which one is cheaper by location.

Check both.

The earlier you book the better deals you'll get.

Unlike restaurants where the food and prices are consistent,
hotels prices and availability fluctuate wildly, so I don't believe in trying for specific hotels -
search and see what is good at that time.

I have on many occasions booked accommodation in the airport lounge minutes before boarding planes
but I do not recommend this.
I have have private hosts cancel my accommodations the day before or even the same day of my arrival
(see [Morocco](#morocco)).

It's annoying to be booking at the last minute because you'll get the least good places for the most expensive prices.

### Internet - Hotel vs Airbnb

Hotel wifi is probably the worst wifi ever,
often averaging around 10Mbit/s, sometimes 7Mbit/s, I've even recorded it as low at 2Mbit/s,
and they tend to have frequent random outages.

The slow speeds - especially throughput and latency variability - can ruin even your audio conference calls, never mind
your video conference calls, especially if you are forced to do them through a corporate Windows Virtual Desktop which
is far more network expensive and latency sensitive.

I have been bitten by this several times.

If Digital Nomadding, try to get out to a cafe with good internet for conference calls, and test their speeds (see the
doc [Network - Speed Test](networking.md#network-speed-test)).
If it's less than 20Mbit/s, find somewhere else.
I've observed good places having wifi speeds of even 70-90Mbit/s and almost no contention due to low number of users.

Internet in Airbnb is either good high speed broadband or broken entirely for the duration.

At one hotel in Thailand, the room wifi was broken the entire week I was there.
I had to sit in the lobby to use the wifi network there, as did others,
and sometimes even that didn't work due to having run out of IP addresses from their DHCP address pool -
a trivial problem to fix if they had even an average IT engineer on hand or over the phone.
I spent all week hassling the reception staff daily pleading to put one on the phone for me to tell them how to fix
it without success).
It still wasn't working when I left there.

Hostels tend to be nearer the hotel end of the wifi internet spectrum, but not usually as bad as hotels in my experience
as the younger crowd of hostels is much more internet dependent and they know this.

### Parking - Hotel, Hostel & Airbnb

If driving, make sure to double check parking at hotels or Airbnbs.

If Expedia shows `Parking Available` include of `Parking Included`, that means there will be parking charges,
which can be quite high.

You have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the hotel listing to find out what the charges are in the small print.

When driving, I often prefer booking places a bit away from the centers to get easier parking as many central
accomodations, both hotels and airbnbs lack good parking.

Also, if you're only going into the centres in the evenings, often you can get cheap or even free parking.

Hostels are usually more central and have no parking, so that's an extra challenge to find external parking locations if
driving, such as my European Summer Road Trip Tours.

### Hostel Tips

#### Lockers

Hostels usually have lockers for valuables (check thel listing before booking).

Some have lockers with a key, others expect you to have a padlock (which they can usually rent to you).

If using hostels repeatedly, get yourself a padlock with a key rather than combination lock,
because aside from the fact someone can just spend a few hours to try all combinations, when you're putting stuff away
late at night, it's must easier with a key than trying to do a combination in the dark with your phone light.

#### Towels

Some hostels provide towels, others rent them to you, and others don't provide them at all.

If using hostels repeatedly,
buy yourself a nice fluffy towel with a high thread count instead of renting them,
it'll work out cheaper in the long run anyway.

#### Shower Gel

At most hostels you will need to take your own shower gel.

#### Pillows

Pillows tend to not be great in hostels.

So in Europe where I road trip, which gives me greater flexibility and luggage capacity, I take my 2 memory foam
pillows.

One could make do with taking one good pillow, but if flying even this might take up valuable space and weight in your
checked luggage suitcase.

#### WorldPackers

You can use [WorldPackers](https://www.worldpackers.com/) to volunteer at hostels in exchange for free board,
which is a great way of seeing the world when young on budget.

## Taxis

Airport taxis are a rip off all over the world. Do not use them.

Use the taxi apps for the specific country,
which are listed below, underneath each country.

Compare the different apps to get the best price, it only takes 2 minutes.

Taxis in some countries only accept cash,
even when ordering them using apps, such as in Albania,
or the airport taxis in Moldova and Malaysia.

Taxis in Thailand and Malaysia stopped at ATMs to get me to withdraw cash for them.

See the [ATM and Foreign Cash Withdrawals](#atms-and-foreign-cash-withdrawals) section below.

## Wifi

### Wifi Hotels

Hotel wifi is often awful, in both signal reliability and speed, even at relatively nice hotels.

### Wifi Cafes & Restaurants

Preserve your mobile data and battery life by not using 4G/5G except when you have to,
always get on the cafe / restaurant wifi.

### Wifi Speeds

I have listed wifi speeds at various venues I've used to digital nomad around as I live on wifi.

_"X/Y Mbit wifi"_ shorthand means X Mbit/s download and Y Mbit/s upload eg.
50/30 means 50 Mbit/s download speed and 30Mbit/s upload speed, as tested using
[network speed test](networking.md#speedtestnet).

## Mobile Internet Access

Always ensure you have mobile internet before you leave the airport or cross the border by car / coach.

Use the airport wifi to set up one of your e-sims using the lists below, or sims at the airports.

On rare occasion I wasn't able to get airport wifi working, and that could be a problem so it's better to sort the e-sim
on the wifi of your departing airport before you take off than arrive at the other end.

### EU Roaming

If you're not an EU resident or don't have an EU sim, skip to the next section [Mobile e-Sims](#mobile-e-sims).

I've used my UK sim from [Smarty](https://smarty.co.uk) across all the EU countries I visited as it permits use of your
plan's bundled service within EU countries at no extra charge, and the monthly contract is cheap as chips.

Now that is progress!

- included calls
- included texts
- up to 12GB of your data plan
  - I actually increased my data plan because I used it for GPS everywhere, and didn't want
    to risk running out

There is a tweak you need to make to your phone to enable it for roaming:

<https://smarty.co.uk/roaming-setup>

which basically comes down to changing your Mobile Service data MMS APN to `mob.asm.net` in your phone settings.

My UK phone number worked across all European countries I travelled through, including:

- Austria
- Bulgaria
- Croatia
- Estonia
- France
- Germany
- Hungary
- Lithuania
- Latvia
- Poland
- Romania
- Sweden
- Slovakia
- Slovenia

It stopped working when I got to Serbia which is not in the EU.

Going from EU to non-EU was a bit of a jarring experience.

There may be something to the EU integration project after all.

### Mobile e-Sims

You can buy data plans for a certain number of days.

Follow the installation instructions and make sure to enable `Data Roaming`
under the e-sim settings otherwise the internet won't connect.

Prices fluctuate and alternate by country so compare the top 3 providers before choosing:

- [Nomad](https://www.getnomad.app/) - a bit cheaper than Airalo,, I've started using this the most
- [Airalo](https://www.airalo.com/) - I used this a lot originally, second cheapest option
- [AloSim](https://alosim.com/) - took a punt and used this for Bosnia as it was the cheapest there

Others:

- [Eskimo](https://www.eskimo.travel/en) - global data plans so you don't lose your remainder and can use it in other
  countries, but in my experience the price per GB is so much more experience that this isn't worth it
- [Holafly](https://esim.holafly.com/) - offers unlimited data but very expensive, usually not worth it given you typically don't use more
  than 1-3GB unless you're watching lots of videos on 4G instead of hotel wifi
- [Saily](https://saily.com/) - WARNING: I haven't use this one yet, but my travel buddy who also travels all year has found Saily to
  be unreliable and had to get refunds from them 3 times across different countries, and warned me not to use it

Not tried these:

- [sSim.sm](https://esim.sm/)
- [Gjirafa eSIM](https://travel.gjirafa.com/en/esim)

<!-- -->

- [Fonus](https://www.fonusmobile.com/) - unlimited worldwide mobile plans

<!-- -->

- [Silent.link](https://silent.link) - Pay-as-You-Go prepaid, anonymous (no KYC, no name or even email),
  pay in [Bitcoin](bitcoin.md) or other [Crypto](crypto.md), account balance doesn't expire,
  but the per GB data rates are higher, priced in USD, and can vary quite substantially even within the same country eg.
  in Thailand it may be \$1.32 on a couple networks and then over \$7 on the True Thailand network.
  The e-sims above usually work out cheaper.
  Get Silent Link as a backup non-expiring balance in case the airport wifi doesn't work to get your e-sim above set up
  or the e-sim loses reception provider and you need GPS for navigation or emergencies

Google [travel e-sims](https://www.google.com/search?q=travel+e-sims)
and add the country you are travelling to for more options.

### Conserve Mobile Data - Pre-Download Offline Google Maps, Translate & Spotify Playlists

Most of my data usage was caused by Google Maps and Spotify
(you can see this on iPhone under `Settings` -> `Mobile Service` further down the page).

Pre-cache your usage when on Wifi to avoid using up too much precious mobile e-sim data:

- Google Maps - download an offline map for your city or area under settings -  you need to keep Google Maps open until
  the download is complete
- Spotify - click the downloaded option on your playlists - by default this will only download on wifi
- Google Translate - download the language (the icon to the left of each language on the language selection drop down)

Give each time to complete and check their progress before setting out and leaving your wifi connection behind.

### International Calls using VoIP over the Internet

Because banks and other legacy providers will force you to call them, you can use one of these services:

- [Viber](https://account.viber.com/en/call-united-kingdom) - 1 week free trial, £5.99 afterwards for unlimited calls (or £1.79 for 100 mins a month),
  but again does not apply to premium or non-geographic numbers like banks often use,
  worked on Barclays number that MoreMins was not processing voice
- [MoreMins](https://www.moremins.com/) - quick, cheap and easy, has an app, £5 for 30 days of unlimited calls,
  use 0800 number to your bank, as premium / national numbers like banks are often using will incur high per-minute
  charges. Blocked me from using Barclays 0800 number. Possible bust option
- [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com/rates) - cheaper than Skype for national calls but hard to use as a foreigner,
  limited to 10 countries, need to use a [VPN](vpn.md) just to try to access it, disappointing usability
- [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/international-calls/) - £5 for 400 minutes, expensive for national numbers like most
  banks and businesses use

## ATMs and Foreign Cash Withdrawals

ATMs in some countries charge a flat fee of between £5-7 for any withdrawal amount -
Thailand, Cambodia, Croatia and Albania spring to mind.

This means it's better to estimate how much you need up front and make fewer larger withdrawals.

Do not use your Wise card to withdraw cash from ATM machines overseas - they charged me almost \$7 as an
_'ATM withdrawal fee'_... on top of the \$5 the Cambodian ATM charged me.

My bank by comparison charged me only the exchange rate, which was very close to accurate, I checked.

Obviously don't withdraw cash using credit cards, they'll likely have the worst / highest unscrupulous charges.

## Restaurants & Dining Out

Use [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com) (see [Mobile Internet Access](#mobile-internet-access) section).

Filter by:

- `Top Rated` on phone or `4.5+` Star rating on desktop
- Distance
- Price eg. `£, ££` or `£££` if it's date night
- Prefer restaurants with higher number of reviews to reduce likelihood of fake reviews swaying / gaming the system
- Places with soft piano music are upmarket (expensive)

Places just outside the centres are often better value for money and top quality food,
but some central places are great too.

Restaurants that close earlier are usually better foodie places, often with more reasonable prices. You'll often pay a
premium for places that are open later, because there are less rival choices open at that time.

I leave a couple recommendations in each location listed below.

Some places don't have English menus -
these are often the best places that aren't so spoilt by foreign money and tourist trap
churn allowing them to lower their standards.

You will need to use a [Translation App](#translation) ...

## Translation

If travelling to a non-English speaking country, I recommend downloading the
[Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/about/) app:

- Translates typed words
- Translates spoken words into typed words and immediately translates them
- Translates pictures replacing words into another language
  - uses Google Lens [AI](ai.md)

## Seasons - Timing Matters

Don't bother with Europe outside of June to August,
the weather is miserable 9 months out of the year and still awful even in late May, supposedly end of Spring,
as well as by September.

## Mosquito Repellent

Buy a good mosquito repellent if you're travelling anywhere near the Mediterranean, Asia or Africa -
I even got eaten in Belgium in summer time!

I find that cream works better than spray.

It is no fun being itchy all the time because these little bastards are biting you every day and night and leaving
lumps all over you.

And you can't feel them land to catch them and can never seem to kill enough of them.

You *need* mosquito repellent. Don't miss it.

## Beware Foreign Police & Customs

You may not understand how despicable institutional corruption is until you've had a first hand run-in with it.

I have been shaken down, fined or blackmailed by Police in countries ranging from South Africa to Latvia to Serbia,
had an
[invasive car search in Sweden](https://medium.com/@harisekhon/the-police-attention-you-get-driving-a-drug-dealer-looking-car-through-europe-d38c5919835f),
and was randomly stopped and questioned a couple times by the UK police on occasions I wore a hoodie
(with hood down during peak daytime 9am-2pm walking along the pavement slowly in broad daylight, not hiding my face).

<!-- TODO: link to medium article on random stop and search experiences -->

**Do not give the police any excuse to stop you.**

### Carry Your Official Documents Everywhere For When You _Are_ Stopped

Carry all of your documents on you safely in case you are stopped
(see [Driving](#driving) section checklist).

### Don't Speed

See the [Driving](#driving) section for more on this.

### Do Not Even Jaywalk

Do not walk across road crossings during red men pedestrian traffic signs as some countries have laws against
_"jay walking"_
which the police may choose
to only enforce against you as a foreigner etc. Some Police wait at major traffic light crossing
waiting for gullible foreigners to make this fineable mistake.

![Dont_trust_the_police](images/dont_need_gun_police_will_protect_you_thought_you_didnt_trust_police.jpeg)

**ps. don't carry guns to other countries! You will almost certainly get put in jail !!**

**pps. Don't even carry tools or anything remotely sharp.
I've even had my shaving razors taken off me at airports -
you never know how they will treat you in a foreign place and it varies significantly.**

## Driving

Ferries are surprisingly expensive, similar or more in price compared a plane ticket.

This probably works out a little more economical if having more than one person in the car.

You should book ahead of time due to limited slots, and for better pricing.

EU countries have town symbols along routes which automatically drop the speed limit to 50kmph whether they declare it
explicitly or not.

This is a local knowledge that will get you done and your license revoked if you hit 100kmph. See [Latvia](#latvia).

### Car Insurance

Car insurance often includes 30-90 days cover in Europe, check each provider for details.

**Beware: UK car insurance covers only EU countries and one or two others like Switzerland and Serbia, but NOT**
**Montenegro, Albania or North Macedonia.**

Not coincidentally these are 3 out of the 4 non-EU countries left in the Balkans
and for good reason as they are clearly the least developed countries.

**You will be forced by the police to buy expensive insurance at the border in those countries if you cannot prove you**
**have a specific insurance covering their country.**

### International Driving Insurance

- [Lobagola](https://www.lobagola-insurance.com/)
  - [Lobagola Balkans](https://www.lobagola-insurance.com/insurance/balkans.html)

#### Temporary Car Insurance Cover

These are relatively very expensive in my experience so I avoid them.

- [GoShorty](https://goshorty.co.uk/temporary-car-insurance/european-car-insurance/) - extremely expensive, £30-36 for
  3 hours!
- [TempCover](https://motor.tempcover.com/) - expensive, quoted me £273 for just 28 days
- [DayInsure](https://www.dayinsure.com/)

### Driving Checklist

Police may refuse you entry or blackmail you out of money if you don't have all of the following documents:

- Passport:
  - South African police laid a trap pulling over foreigners coming out of
    [Sandton](#sandton) - primarily a rich foreigner area.
    My guess is they were targeting rental cars in an attempt to extort fines / bribes from foreigners not carrying
    their passports and even document imaginable including driving license and international driver's permit.
    <!-- TODO: medium story this full exchange -->
- UK driver's license
- International driver's permit (get this from the Post Office it's only around £5 but requires a passport photo)
- Insurance certificate
  - check it covers the specific country, see note above that non-EU countries are often not covered
- Vehicle Registration V5C paper proof of ownership
  - [Serbian](#serbia) police refused to accept digital proof of ownership via insurance certificate
  - they insisted on physical original paper copy
  - they said it was the equivalent to *"Passport for the car"*

### Additional EU Driving Checklist

Driving in the EU additionally requires:

- breakdown kit (AA does one), including:
  - high viz jacket (which must be available in the passenger compartment
  - breakdown triangle
  - headlamp converters

Headlamp converters are basically headlamp stickers that change the glare direction of your headlamps to shine the other
way because you drive on the right in Europe instead of the left like in the UK.

Apparently the French police are likely to pull you over and fine you if you don't have these.

### EU Motorway Tolls

Socialist Europeans find extra ways to tax you
and you need to buy motorway passes when driving in several European countries or face fines.

There are automated cameras so you are likely to get hit with fines if you don't buy one of these in advance.

See here for some details of which countries and prices.

<https://www.autoeurope.com/travel-tips/vignette-stickers/>

Specific countries purchase apps and websites are listed under each country.

### Do Not Speed

Do not speed, you only need to go a meagre 50kmh above the speed limit and the [Latvian](#latvia) police will revoke
your license.

This is easy to do in towns which are set to only 50kmph speed limits whether they explicitly declare it or not.

If you see a car pushing into the back of you, do not speed up.

It may be a police car that will only put on its siren after you've increased speed to breach the +50kmph maximum
penalty of €360 euros and a revoked license.

The extended time pulled over by the police not knowing if they are going to arrest you and impound your vehicle on top
of revoking your license will set you back a lot more time than any speed up would give you.

It's quite possible they do this on purpose 15 minutes from the Estonia border to catch unsuspecting foreigners driving
between the countries.

Let cars overtake you than fall for this unmarked police car entrapment.

### Parking

Use [Parkopedia](https://www.parkopedia.com/) to find parking and see its pricing up front to not get ripped off.
Occasionally the parking might be slightly more expensive than Parkopedia's latest knowledge.

There are apps for Parkopedia for iPhone and Android.

In the Parkopedia app, once you've selected the car park you can, share it to Waze to plan the journey there.

Do not use Waze to get to the city and then try to find parking, that's more difficult, and Waze will often send you to
some random part of a city, which has little there.

## EU Schengen Visa Calculator

I use a Google Sheets spreadsheet with formulas but this is also helpful.

This is easy to use as you just have to click your entry / exit dates:

<https://schengenareacalculator.com/>

This is less easy to use because you have to manually enter the dates:

<https://www.visa-calculator.com/>

## Emigration

### Taxes

Brits leaving in the middle of a UK tax year (April 6th - April 5th next year) will have a declare a split tax year to
HMRC.

It's best to plan ahead and leave just before April 5th to not contaminate another next tax year with HMRC able to claim
tax off you that quite frankly the UK doesn't deserve at this point.

[Tax Advice for Emigrating or Going Digital Nomad](https://medium.com/@harisekhon/tax-advice-for-emigrating-or-going-digital-nomad-c100fba461ed)

### Mail Redirection

Brits may want to [redirect their mail overseas](https://www.postoffice.co.uk/mail/redirection) or
get a [PO Box](https://www.royalmail.com/receiving/po-box) to collect on return visits.

- Hertfordshire:

- Gloucestershire:
  - [Cotswolds](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ltn9WceBcb2xESS79)

<!-- - ~~[Reading](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sPzxGJPXa59LGvHM6)~~ -->

Most of the areas apart from Central London are small enough you can cover their key central parts in 1-2 days each.

#### Best Areas in London

Central London you could easily spend over 2 weeks to just see the highlights, eg.
a day at each of these:

1. Natural History Museum (excellent)
1. Kensington & Kensington Palace Gardens (excellent multi-area kids playground) & the large Hyde Park (these are joined)
1. Big Ben, Houses of Parliament, London Eye, Sea Life aquarium, South Bank restaurants & seasonal street food stalls
1. Buckingham Palace & St James Park, Belgravia, Chelsea
1. Oxford Street and Regent Street for shopping
1. Picadilly, China Town, Soho restaurants and bars
1. The British Museum
1. Knightsbridge - Harrods famous department store has nearly everything, even posh food and souvenir teas
1. Marylebone & Regents Park
1. Notting Hill market, street food, clothing and restaurants (market runs on Saturdays only)
1. Richmond & Richmond Park (excellent)
1. Hampton Court Palace gardens & Bushy Park (excellent)
1. Tower Bridge & Borough Market
1. Greenwich, the Cutty Sark, Royal Observatory, Mudchute Farm
1. Camden Town, Kings Cross, Angel, Islington
1. Westfields mall at Shepherds Bush (it's better than the one at Stratford)
1. Shoreditch, Baribican, Spitalfields Market, Brick Lane for authentic Indian cuisine on a night out

You will not be able to hit all the good areas with good restaurants in 2 weeks actually because London has so many,
there are other areas like the City financial district around Bank of England through to Canary Wharf,
as well as other zone 2-5 areas like Earl's Court, Fulham, Putney, Barnes, Hammersmith, Wimbledon, Twickenham,
Teddington, Ealing Broadway, South Woodford, Wanstead, Bromley, Beckenham, Chessington theme park etc.

#### Best Restaurants in London

London is easily the restaurant capital of the world,
not even California can boast the variety and quality of London restaurants, nor can any other city on this list.

I prioritize food quality and price,
so we'll start with more independent and affordable places, then move to more fancy further down.

There are simply far too many great restaurants in London to list them all, especially from 2 decades of memories,
and nobody can agree on a definitive top list, but here is a good start:

- [Taro (Soho)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xbh6RB5YUFj6njTi9) - foodie place for Japanese noodles and sushi. The bento
  boxes here were my favourite
- [Yalla Yalla](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WK3RLN6t9pCkUGkN6) - a favourite Lebanese of mine in Soho.
  The sujuk sausages in lemon zesty sauce were my favourite of any place,
  and I've forever been disappointed in Turkish restaurants sujuk by comparison.
  Fattoush salad is a must here (or any lebanese / syrian or similar restaurant!).
  The houmous with lamb is a worthy upgrade too and stuffed vine leaves are always good.
  I liked the homemade lemonades as they were exotic mixes (Pomegranate & Orange Blossom, Watermelon & Rose, or Apple, Mint & Ginger).
  The Mouhalabia dessert was my favourite here.
  There is also a sister restaurant [Yalla Beirut](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Gn5NZE72UkdQv1Za7) at Tower Hill
- [Black Bear Burger](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mu94ZHu3mVo3mbM49) - the black bear and brisket burger were both good, as
  were the fries
- [Hiba Street Food](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7wwTZAgRghbvPNv27) - good Lebanese food
- [Wagamama](https://www.wagamama.com/) - modern Japanese chain,
  soup noodle bowls, pan fried noodles, and some rice based dishes with fresh squeezed juices.
  Top picks here:
  - Starters:
    - Chilli Squid - coated in a light batter with a lovely sweet chilli dip - these are almost the same price as mains
      so relatively expensive yet everybody keeps ordering it's probably their best & most popular starter
    - Ebi Katsu - prawns in breadcrumbs with a great chill & garlic dip - be sure to ask for extra lime and drown the
      breadcrumbs in lime individually just before dipping them in the chilli and eating them for maximum impact!
    - Lollipop Prawn Kushyaki - marinated in lemongrass & chill - drown them in lime juice from the caramelized half lime
    - Chicken Yakitori starter
    - Gyoza are ok but not elite - the best ones are the crispy fried with duck filling and sweet cherry hoisin dipping
      sauce, followed by the steam chicken filled with chilli, soy & sesame dipping sauce.
      I haven't tried the new beef & kimchi ones yet
  - Mains:
    - Chicken Katsu Curry is a mild non-spicy sauce coating breadcrumbed chicken with white rice - easily one of the
      most popular dishes
    - Chill Chicken Ramen (soup bowl) - easily one of the most popular dishes - ask for it with Udon noodles instead of
      Ramen, they're better, and ask for extra lime for it.
      It is much better than the Grilled Chicken Ramen.
      There is also a beef variation but it's more expensive
    - Firecracker Prawn / Chicken - one of my favourite ever picks, but be warned it is seriously spicy!
      The prawn variation is better because the chicken requires more chewing so your mouth will get more burnt from the
      spice. Pro tip: ask for extra lime and drown it in lime to get maximum tastebud activation of spicy and lime
    - Prawn / Chicken Raisukaree Curry - mild coconut curry with rice and mangetout
    - Yaki Udon - pan fried udon noodles with chicken and prawns - simple but effective
    - Duck Donburi - teriyaki sauce coated shredded duck on white rice, not one of their bigger dishes, but tasty, so
      I used to order this when less hungry
    - Chicken & Prawn Pad Thai - for the less adventurous who just want some basic noodle dish - kids love this one too
    - Tantanmen Beef Brisket Ramen - korean bbq beef, it's ok, but mainly because you've already eaten the above ones
      too much and need something new becaues the kids make you take them here every weekend
  - Kids love the mini chicken yaki soba noodle bowl (ask for it with udon noodles instead it's better)
  - Drinks:
    - I like the Positive and High Five juices the most
  - Desserts:
    - Coconut Reika Ice Cream - 3 scoops of coconut ice cream with coconut flakes and passionfruit sauce, good to share
      in a couple
    - Banana Katsu - tastes great but it's two small pieces of banana and one scoop of vanilla ice cream - I wish it was
      bigger because I could eat 2-3 of these
    - White Chocolate & Ginger Cheesecake - very decent cheesecake
- [GBK - Gourmet Burger Kitchen](https://www.gbk.co.uk/) - good selection of big juicy burgers, good chunky fries, and
  milkshakes.
  I used to dine in the Soho branch weekly with my regular group of my foodie colleagues,
  and later when I worked at a less social investment bank I still got Kiwi Burger takeaways from here regularly.
  The menu changes slightly periodically, with occasional specials.
  The Habanero Burger used to be elite before they switched to overly sweet cost optimized Habanero Jam.
  The Kiwi Burger was another favourite with pineapple and eggs toppings, but they don't do it any more either.
  Please tell GBK to bring them back!
  The Taxi Driver, Texan, Rocketman or Gravy Train would be my remaining picks,
  or just try the basic Classic if not feeling adventurous.
  I'm not as keen on the chicken burgers here
- [Patty & Bun](https://www.pattyandbun.co.uk/) - one of my favourite burger chains, I used to get a takeaway from the
  Tottenham Court Road one every other day when I worked in the area.
  I loved their chips & dip, as well as their 3 main burgers, Ari Gold, Smokey Robinson and Jose Jose Chilli Burger
- [Honest Burgers](https://www.honestburgers.co.uk/) - another good burger chain.
  The chilli burger is my favourite here. I've been to the St Albans one outside London in the home county too
- [Wahaca](https://www.wahaca.co.uk/) - modern Mexican chain, I used to go to the Soho branch weekly with my colleagues.
  THe tacos are good sides/extra to have here.
  I used to like the steak and chicken mains, but it looks like they don't do them any more.
  I particularly like the Horchata sweet milk drink with cinnamon
- [Busaba](https://www.busaba.com/) - Thai chain, nice decor and food, portions and drinks not too big but nice
- [Joe & The Juice](https://www.joejuice.com/) - danish juice chain, good selection of fresh pressed juices, expensive,
  but we pay it so they are everywhere - I like the "Sports Juice" here, pineapple based juice with passion fruit and
  apple, as well as the classic "Go Away Doc" of apple, carrot and ginger
- [Burger & Lobster](https://www.burgerandlobster.com/) - their original gimmick was they used to price both their
  lobster and their burger at a flat £20, making it an expensive burger or an affordable lobster.
  Unfortunately, the lobster is now £40
- [Flat Iron](https://flatironsteak.co.uk/) - affordable steak chain, good for the price
- [Ippudo](https://www.ippudo.co.uk/) - Japanese
- [Nandos](https://www.nandos.co.uk/) - everybody loves Nandos peri-peri chicken chain,
  so like Wagamama, it's everywhere.
  Not as affordable as it used to be, but still not as expensive as some other places.
  The mixed olive starter is a popular choice here.
  The usual pick for mains is 1/2 chicken (or 1/4 chicken if not that hungry) with 2 sides of chips and rice.
  Drown the rice in Medium / Garlic / Wild Herb sauces, eat it,
  then use the rice bowl to pour the sauces in to heavily dunk each individual chip in for maximum flavour impact!
  For the experienced you can upgrade to Hot or XXX Hot but do not do this as a beginner
  because nearly all the sauces are more spicy than you would have at another restaurant
- [Roosters Peri Peri Chicken](https://www.roosterspiripiri.com/) - affordable peri peri chicken chain.
  Chicken wrap with fries and rice were my picks here
- [Nostimo Mediterranean Gastronomy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wmPzKGdA1TtJG5Pq5) - Greek, good quality, had the skewer
  plates which are good and come with major meats, chicken, pork, beef or lamb.
  The top 3 desserts on the menu were all good (Ekmek Kataifi, Portokalopita, Galaktompoureko).
  The bill racks up quicker than you'd expect here, and is not £10-20 as Google Maps suggests as the three of us blew
  nearly £50 per head without alcohol, which was a little pricey
- [Big Easy](https://www.bigeasy.co.uk/) - much better American BBQ than TGI Fridays
- [Pizza Express](https://www.pizzaexpress.com/) - good quality upmarket pizza restaurant
- [Pho](https://www.phocafe.co.uk/) - vietnamese noodle soup chain, like the Vietnamese Wagamama. Summer rolls and Pho
  soup are the obvious picks here
- [Zizzi](https://www.zizzi.co.uk/) - Italian restaurant chain - the Rustica pizzas are a good size here
- [Browns](https://www.browns-restaurants.co.uk/#/) - moderately upmarket brasserie chain of british food
- [Carluccio's](https://www.carluccios.com/) - mid-market Italian restaurant chain
- [Rosas Thai](https://rosasthai.com/) - Thai restaurant chain, passable, but independent Thai places are better for
  both food and price / value for money though
- [Dishoom](https://www.dishoom.com/) - modern Indian chain
- [Franco Manca](https://www.francomanca.co.uk/) - I'm not big on this chain, but some people like it for pizza
- [Banana Tree](https://bananatree.co.uk/) - south east asian chain
- [Bone Daddies](https://bonedaddies.com/) - well rated and they highly rate their bone broth, I don't recall rating it
  as highly

<!-- -->

<!--

- ~~Ichi Rikki~~ - great Japanese sushi restaurant with an excellent udon noodle soup, authentic and well priced, and
  their soft-shelled crab was good too.
  Shame it's permanently closed down.
  Damn London rents and unproductive fatcat landlords

<!-- -->

- [Marks & Spencer](https://www.google.com/maps/search/marks+%26+spencer/) - not a restaurant but useful for picnic
  foods and belgian chocolate covered peanuts, which I used to be addicted to, and still buy a couple bags when in

<!-- Purl - my first date with Gemma - saved it only for her - shame it's closed down now -->

More upmarket (expensive) restaurants:

- [Dinner by Heston Blumenthal](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dpiPUpg9QDXEt47VA) - creative menu, unique
- [The Ivy](https://ivycollection.com/) - I took my ex-girlfriend to the one in Richmond, it was good.
  The scallops starter with pea puree stood out in my memory. Mains instead steaks, burgers and seafood
- [Yauatcha Soho](https://maps.app.goo.gl/P12FCb2DTgPei6Xh8) - upmarket Chinese with dim sum, the red fez desserts with
  edible gold on top were as tasty as there were impressive looking in the blue glass windows
- [Hakkasan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/J88xeebe9y5FUo3n7) - upmarket Chinese with dim sum and stylish decor
- [Gaucho](https://gauchorestaurants.com/) - upmarket Argentinian steak restaurant chain - very good - I recommend you get the Fillet
  Mignon medium rare (it's the most tender, leanest, highest quality steak).
  It still doesn't have desserts after all these years, I have no idea why
- [Sticks n Sushi](https://www.sticksnsushi.com/gb/en/) - upmarket (expensive) sushi restaurant chain
- [Salt Yard](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uKhJrjkdyznutkQw5) - upmarket tapas, not cheap, I took my ex-girlfriend here when
  we were in the first few months of dating
- [Gordan Ramsey](https://www.gordonramsayrestaurants.com/restaurants-and-bars/) - the famous celebrity chef's
  restaurants are usually good, and while not cheap, not the most expensive in London either
- [Sake No Hana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hcr4okhpzNuoRKGs6) - sushi & cocktails - good but expensive. I took my
  ex-girlfriend here for our second date and blew around £300. Closed down now unfortunately
- [Hawksmoor](https://thehawksmoor.com/) - well rated steakhouse, I didn't think it was that special compared to the
  more unique restaurants above
- [Buenos Aires Argentinian Steakhouse](https://www.barestaurant.com/) - Gaucho is better
- [Julie's](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EZBf4R2S28GyGvdAA) - upmarket french restaurant at Holland Park

Not Recommended:

- [The Real Greek](https://www.therealgreek.com/) - the worst blandest least authentic Greek food I ever had. Don't
  waste your money or one of your meals on this mediocrity
- [Bill's](https://bills-website.co.uk/) - mediocre burgers, don't go unless you have no other choice
- [Cote](https://www.cote.co.uk/) - didn't like their chicken, for the price you can eat a lot of better places. I don't
  get the appeal or niche of this chain
- [Yo Sushi](https://yosushi.com/) - it used to be a lot better, I used to go often, now it doesn't seem worth the
  price, especially as they removed a the seafood udon soup which was one of their best dishes
- [Itsu](https://www.itsu.com/) - mediocre Japanese chain, don't bland yourself to death..
  It's not terrible, it's just that you could eat better or for less elsewhere now
- [TGI Fridays](https://www.tgifridays.co.uk/) - mediocre American chain.
  For this money, you could get better variations at places like Big Easy.
  Not worth the damage to your health or your wallet

A couple of my other favourite independent places like [Ichi Ricki](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3zM4cY9M4fPEZYbM9),
Po Cha korean bibimbap at Tottenham Court Road, Ping Pong upmarket dim sum chain, are permanently
closed down, as are other notables Shaka Zulu and Sake No Hana. Damn London rent prices, the big chains are taking over.

### USA

You will get finger printed entering the country.

I've worked up and down that Los Angeles part...

![How Rest of World Sees USA](images/how_rest_of_world_sees_usa.jpeg)

#### California

California, the once golden place is not what it used to be after doubling its population from mass immigration.

Weather is great though, restaurants are decent (London's restaurants are better though).

Many of these places are only places to go on company expense as the hotels will set you back quite a lot per night.

Americans are now fleeing the failing Democrat state for Texas, which will then become the next domino to fall.

[In-and-Out Burger](https://www.in-n-out.com/) is a popular burger chain local to California, considered better than your
average chain by many locals.
The _"animal fries"_ covered in fried onions and gravy was too much even for me though.

- [Irvine](#irvine)
- [Los Angeles](#los-angeles)
- [Palo Alto](#palo-alto)
- [San Diego](#san-diego)
- [San Francisco](#san-francisco)

##### Irvine

A nicer more suburban manufactured city than LA, with decent shops and restaurants.

##### Los Angeles

A giant square grid of blocks. From the plane it looks like The Matrix.

Hollywood boulevard is nothing fancy in the grand scheme of things.
It's just a tourist strip of a few restaurants and shops.

Rodeo Drive is the upmarket shopping road of expensive designer brands.

Beverley Hills are not as fancy as one would believe from Beverley Hills Cop movies.
More like a $1M+ middle class area.

[Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ](https://lucillesbbq.com/menu) is the best BBQ I've had in the entire world.
I've been searching for a BBQ place to match it across countries for over a decade now and nothing has come close.
The warm apple-cinnamon bun starters are amazing as are the giant beef ribs with the best BBQ glaze I've ever had.
My colleagues and I drove half way across LA to go to this because everybody knows it is the best.
If you're in LA or one of their expanded locations, do not miss it.
Looks like they now have a couple branches in Vegas and one in Phoenix, Arizona too.

[Crustacean](https://crustaceanbh.com/menu/) in Beverley Hills is a good upmarket seafood restaurant with fish in the
see-through floor as you enter. Impressive. Recommended if you want something a bit more upmarket.

##### Palo Alto

A tech hub town with serious tech millionaire money, as evidenced by things like the McLaren showroom.

It was the first place I ever recall seeing a Tesla in 2013. When the traffic lights turned green,
for a moment I thought our car wasn't even moving relative to seeing it take off and leaving us behind in our
Infinity Q37.

Quite nice area, if you can afford it.

##### San Diego

A somewhat more chill city than Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Restaurants were not that cheap though.

##### San Francisco

Too expensive for even most of my engineer colleagues at Cloudera to live in.

There were homeless people on every block in 2013 when I was there. It's apparently much worse now.

Beware if you walk just one block west of the central shopping district you'll end up on the road of Tenderloin
which is full of drug addicts in broad daylight.
Walking through a group of 4 drug addicts on the pavement is not a pleasant experience
even if you think you could take them.
Not recommended for women.

[Boudin](https://boudinbakery.com/) is a local chain famous for its sour dough bread and soup in bread bowls.

### Vietnam

#### Taxis in Vietnam

If you haven't already set up your card to prepay on the Grab app, you'll need cash.

- [Grab](https://www.grab.com/) - taxi app

#### Hanoi

Don't got to Hanoi in the winter - it is not Thailand, it is cold and you will need a jacket due to the high lattitude.

- [Mình ơiii!](https://maps.app.goo.gl/863GxZHZ6r25ocM69) - small venue, summer rolls prawn were sold out,
  udon noodle pork soup was small but great, and the spring rolls come very hot fresh and crispy, fair prices too
- [Saltfee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hXC6XCDmBDemKJAV9) - the Guaberry iced tea is very nice, has wifi and a
  small balcony overlooking the street on the upper level
- [Hidden Alley](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uCTs4Xji1J4kubf47) - hidden gem, great interior with low lighting,
  interesting menu and wifi
- [Laika Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DNCerEaNfxDj1J2h8) - interesting drinks menu, outdoor terrace seating and wifi.
  The plum / passionfruit ice cream teas with jelly pieces was surprisingly good!
- [Puku Cafe & Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/srUuuBWUHQN8KDKn7) - 24x7 with wifi and reasonable prices, the stir fried
  beef noodles are really good, and also the peach iced tea or orange lemongrass peach iced tea with peach slices in them
- [Aroi Dessert Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YDd36mNVNmnx84zYA) -
  open 24 hours with good upper level seating as well as street seating, not only until 10:30pm as Google says.
  The `Aroi Dessert Cafe` wifi runs out of IP addresses, ask them for the password for the `Aroi Staff` wifi instead
- [Le Monde Steak](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C3AZkhWGYY7CfUAo8) - steaks, pasta, good drinks, reasonable prices and wifi
- [Hong Haoi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tHagvFRbC1Ugm9dJA) - popular restaurant in Old Town, small and busy
  The recommended fried fish is good and the juice is fresh squeezed,
  although not big (uses those milkshake glasses that are narrow at the bottom).
- [Don Duck](https://maps.app.goo.gl/joEGkujXGGJo4Nrq8) - small popular affordable restaurant specializing in duck.
  Reasonable prices, but the spring rolls weren't crispy and the duck soup while very affordable could have had better
  cuts of duck and less duck skin. Still for this price one shouldn't complain

#### Ho Chi Minh (formerly known as Saigon)

I much prefer this to Hanoi, it is ~1000km south with much better weather, better tourist areas,
but more expensive to eat and drink there.

[District 1](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HM1EcK3Tnrf25aR4A) is where you want to stay here.

- [Ben Thanh Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SePL2UKPEa75bHo16) - indoor market with food, juices, clothes, souvenirs
  etc. Eat here, it's much cheaper than most restaurants in the area
- [Đ. Bùi Viện](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ydZUkM2HUPgdwt7r5) - Walking Street of bars, clubs and restaurants. Buzzing,
  but expensive. Eat elsewhere, stop here for drinks and dancers
- [Ben Nghe Street Food](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JuWedMQJtq9JKjwQ8) - international mix of street food vendors, twice
  the price of the cheap eats places in Ben Thanh Market, but more variety and better social benches seating
- [The Hungry Pig](https://maps.app.goo.gl/W5KcfRHYC9jFLiYi9) - very good full english breakfast, paninis, burgers,
  big drink sizes, reasonable prices. The bacon is well done just the way I like it, in both the english breakfast and
  panini. The 'Fish & Chips' is more like fish goujons and chips, and smaller portion than a grand Fish & Chips of
  England. This is my favourite place for breakfast
- [Little HaNoi Egg Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XjfTPMq31ci2xJf86) - eggs, salmon, avocado type breakfast, good
  drinks such as peach ice tea with peaches in it
- [Quán ăn Bác Hiền](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hKbmBcmTAdyyXKzm7) - excellent cheap street food restaurant, ignore the
  mediocre Google rating, the locals eat and socialize here, you will eat and drink well for less than everywhere else
- [Chez Mimosa Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3ohXRm9hDWdbLRRL7) - affordable 3 course breakfast with a drink included,
  good quality, has wifi
- [Kyobashi Sushi Izakaya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3RAoMiRfzMuvHKRh8) - very good quality, soup noodles, sushi, skewers
  moderately priced, in thhe area of bar girls where you will seconded everywhere
- [Acai Bliss](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eUyM3zA7J8d2nuxE6) - acai bowls for around £5, good by international standards
  but expensive for here, was quite Sunday midday, and a bit of a walk from the main areas
- [Pure Bowls](https://maps.app.goo.gl/c7QKZc6f4fukao1x9) - another acai bowl place near Ben Thanh
- [Codonut](https://maps.app.goo.gl/z6P2dpn1nGb8goeb8) - coconut ice cream falvours in coconut bowl, with toppings,
  open late until 1am for late night treats, with seat both inside and on the street to people watch
- [Melbourne Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F7CbiqbHkB3en9kQA) - good mixed juices, English breakfast, pancake stacks,
  wifi, moderate prices, vietnamese food at the back of menu is cheaper
- [Me In Noodle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FjkCyUYhGCk9inxb8) - next to Ben Thanh Market, very interesting noodles menu,
  twice the price of the cheap places inside the Ben Thant market hall but full busy with foreigners,
  and the adjacent Mama's Kitchen restaurant has a different menu and also full
- [Hello Saigon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VNXgnuDVmC1VyD1u5) - good food, reasonable prices,
  the seafood crispy taro salad is good but cold, the mango and peach teas are too sweet despite asking them to reduce
  sugar and second time around no sugar, must be due to lots of syrup
- [Chez Gilbert Saigon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/z4LGFADNZZauuWrA6) - has breakfast / lunch deal specials, but they're
  not as big and filling as the above places. Good if you need wifi though
- [Xèo Restaurant - MeKong](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xWnpeWFSWwf1ygWZ7) - good food, reasonable prices, seafood rice
  noodles were very tasty, portion could have been a bit bigger but then I’m probably just greedy
- [Kyobashi Sushi Izakaya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cJYkDmYnLzmE6hTRA) - high quality Japanese restaurant, very good
  good with reasonable prices, serving noodle soups and a great selection of sushi and grill skewers, slightly off the
  beaten track in the alleys with lots of bar girls
- [Vincom Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fn87yQusZTwmsZMJ8) - shopping center with a lot of good looking restaurants
  on the lowest floor. Will be pricier than Ben Thanh Market
- [SIPFÉ coffee & sweets](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f3vBwFMg1XvLEhqu7) - fancy coffee place, nice drinks. Lots of girls
  dressing up and having their friends take pics of them due to the nice surroundings
- [Antiko Kafe 24/7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2eMS2EFFkAbipvgS8) - 24 hour student cafe, 3 floors.
  Tropical iced tea was good and full of fruit.
  There is lots of seating, wifi, plugs, lots of students there at midnight
- [Phê La - Hồ Tùng Mậu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wBQrLuBZRovBHpp67) - busy coffee shop with big teas, wifi and lots of
  seating upstairs, many people are on laptops there, and there are plugs to charge. Ignore the mediocre Google rating
  and look at how busy it is with mainly locals...
- [Maan+ Coffee & Tea](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TgbhdK8oPWzaYbgV7) - popular late night tea / coffee place used mainly by
  locals with lots of street seating, open until 2am
- [KOI Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qu4B3oRg2jptfkMRA) - opposite the Saigon center mall.
  Bubble tea shop on ground floor, coffee shop on 1st floor, seating on 2nd floor for teas from ground floor.
  Wifi code required from receipt (10 digit integer) for 120 minutes (this seems stingy compared to other coffee shops)
  and the plugs do not hold the adapters. Not as good as Phe La down the road
- [7 Bridges Craft Beer Taproom & Restaurant / Lê Thánh Tôn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gNu4NjdCwXFotyqh6) -
  drinks downstairs, cosy restaurant on 3rd floor, good for a date
- [Go2 Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9JRJdoUwsQZ3JKj8A) - listen to the live music from Lost in Saigon across the street
  at a more comfortable distance and volume, and the drinks are cheaper too. People watch the entrance to Walking Street
- [Carmen Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/66UqEuGme1PBFdo39) - expensive romantic bar with live music, use this only for
  dates, it is opposite and alongside expensive high end luxury hotels
- [YOYO BEER GARDEN Hồ Con Rùa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e2CTUE1vqqh7NHF7A) - banging and full at night, mostly locals
- [Quan Pho Con Bo Vang](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gibc8HohmBNtcSUB7) - cheap local eats place
