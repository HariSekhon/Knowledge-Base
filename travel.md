## Booking Sites

Always compare 2-3 sites as you might think one will always get you a better deal,
but once in a while it'll screw you with a much higher price than the others.

[Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com/) - discover how to get anywhere by plane, train, bus, ferry and car. Especially
useful if you're touring a region like Europe where things are not very far apart.

[Agoda.com](https://www.agoda.com/) - the best site for use in Asia, and you really need to go to Asia, it's amazing.

[HostelWorld.com](https://www.hostelworld.com/) - best for solo hostel travellers - sometimes more expensive than Agoda
for the same places, but sometimes has hostels that other sites don't have at all.
People are often willing to pay a slight premium to book through HostelWorld just to get access to it's unique city chat
feature to meet other solo travellers to socialize.
The chat is a bit sluggish and buggy, so I use this chat to collect the IGs and then start a better Insta group chat.
HostelWorld usually takes a deposit (which doesn't go to the hostel and is non-refundable if you cancel), and then you
pay the hostel when you arrive.
This means you are slightly better off booking a shorter time on the app to pay less deposit but still get access to
the city chat and then extending your stay locally with the hostel - as long as the hostel isn't likely to run out of
capacity!
There is a limitation in the app / website that you cannot change your booked duration once purchased,
and beware that if you cancel the booking (eg. because you want to shorten the duration for example at the request of
your hostel to free up the bed on their system) you will lose both your deposit and access to the chat, and the customer
service support cannot undo the cancellation for you either.

[Kayak.com](https://www.kayak.com/) - usually cheaper than SkyScanner and had cheaper flights not found on Expedia.
  lI prefer Kayak to SkyScanner because I can filter for flights including luggage in the price
  and when following through to [eDreams](https://www.edreams.com/) or [Trip.com](https://trip.com/) flights I can
  upgrade to 25kg luggage for ~£4, which is important because I got charged $30 for having 22kg checked luggage -
  2kg over the 20kg default luggage allowance of many airlines.
  Booking.com and Kiwi.com are bad for this only option of adding 20kg checked luggage

[SkyScanner.net](https://www.skyscanner.net/) - had cheaper flights that weren't even found on Expedia,
and cheaper on the same flights too

[Booking.com](https://www.booking.com) - cheaper and more hotels than Expedia, but sucks because it only allows you to add 20kg checked
luggage, which left me getting screwed for a $30 surcharge for being 2kg over on my checked luggage

[Expedia](https://expedia.co.uk) - LEGACY DO NOT USE.
Was my usual go to as it usually had the most options at the last minute, until SkyScanner and Kayak
showed it up.
Beware if you are trying
to get a hotel immediately for a missed flight the app will shunt the results to the next day
and you will end up booking the wrong night and then having a horrible battle trying to get it refunded.
Booking.com is better for that scenario.
Also, if you book the wrong date or there is any issue Expedia support are the worst ever.
You will struggle to get any refund.
Use them to find the hotels and flights,
then go book directly with the airline or hotel and deal with them directly if there is any problem.
You'll usually get a slight discount or other perk and when there is a problem you will not be stuck suffering Expedia
chat support.

[AirBnb](https://www.airbnb.com) - compare the cost of apartments to hotels in each area, it alternates which is
cheaper depending on the country.

[LastMinute.com](https://lastminute.com) - ok for package holidays but assumed return flights,
less good for a digital nomad who is going one way and bouncing to the next place.

[OnTheBeach.co.uk](https://www.onthebeach.co.uk/) - good prices but nothing available for same/next day for last minute
travellers like me.

## Flights

Book ahead of time for better price comparisons.

Same goes for ferries if driving.

Favourite Airline: Air Arabia because they didn't tell me to put my laptop away during takeoff. One less pointless rule
enforced.

### Flight Booking Sites

Ranked by my success in finding affordable flights

- [Kayak.com](https://www.kayak.com/) - even cheaper than SkyScanner and had cheaper flights not found on Expedia
- [SkyScanner.net](https://www.skyscanner.net/) - had cheaper flights that weren't even found on Expedia, and cheaper on the same flights too
- [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com)
- [Agoda.com](https://www.agoda.com/) - better for hotels than flights
- [Expedia](https://expedia.co.uk) - fewer and more expensive flights
- [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/travel/flights)

### Flight Deals from the US

If you just want to go on hols and don't mind where, then you can use:

<https://www.going.com/>

Enter your nearest airport(s) and they will send you cheap deals to random destinations.

Unfortunately they do not serve airports outside the US at time of writing.

### Flight Gotchas

#### Luggage

Be careful with your luggage weight. I got charged $30 in Asia for being 2kg overweight.

It is usually much cheaper to just book a larger luggage weight in advance, such as 25kg instead of 20kg.

If doing short trips, you might be better off not taking checked luggage at all as budget airlines like Whizz Air charge
you a lot extra on top of the initial flight cost to have a checked luggage, and if only going somewhere for 2-3 days
you really only need a change of clothes and minimal toiletries.

The real problem is if you have lots of toiletries for skincare routines etc,
as it can be hard to get it through the airport security and need that checked luggage.

#### Transfer Flight Timings

**Do not take transfer flights with less than 3-4 hours between them.**

It is common for the first flight to be delayed by 1.5 hours
and then you don't have enough time to catch the second flight.
Even more so if you have to go through security again which can delay you by another 30-60 minutes.

I have gotten stranded overnight in Warsaw like this on the way from London to Tbilisi, with no replacement flight for
24 hours.
And of course there is no hotel availability at 11:30pm except for £200-300+ per night hotels.

#### Self Transfer

Avoid `Self Transfer`.

This is a hack by comparison sites matching unrelated airline flights.

If the first flight is delayed, which is common, the other airline won't care or wait for you.

You will lose the second flight you paid for.
They try to sell you additional insurance in this case to potentially offer you another
flight but who's to say that will be the next decent flight instead of the cheapest possible.

This is how you can get stranded at airports for awfully long periods of time wearing you down.

I've learnt this one the hard way when my flight from Tbilisi, Georgia, to Antalya, Turkey, was delayed by 1hr30mins
so I had no chance of catching the other flight which was only 2 hours apart.
Worse still it was at another terminal
that was 2km away so I even had to take a taxi to the other terminal for the other flight.

You will also lose time collecting luggage, going through a new check-in, security again etc.

Stick to the same airline transfers, they will be aware that their counterpart flight was delayed
and are more likely to hold the flight to give everyone time to transfer.

#### Change Airport

Beware there is no `CHANGE AIRPORT` stopover as you'd have to travel between airports across a city or region
and this makes it even more likely that you'll miss a connecting flight.

It's even worse than the `Self Transfer`.

## Hotels vs Hostels vs Airbnb

After a lot of travelling, I have come to the conclusion that you can judge a place by the cost of its accommodation.

In Croatia for example, you can pay £30-50 per night for hostel,
which is ridiculous as you could stay in a full private hotel room in Dubai for £55.

If a place has expensive accommodation, either consider travelling to somewhere else better value if holidaying,
or shorten your trip there and then go somewhere better value for longer.

**If you're travelling alone, don't waste your time & money on Hotels or Airbnbs, use hostels, they're more social and**
**1/3 of the price.
Save your money and spend it on good food in restaurants instead.
Hostels have lockers for your valuables like laptops (you may want to take your own stronger padlock).**

Hotels and [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com) vary as to which one is cheaper by location.

Check both.

The earlier you book the better deals you'll get.

Unlike restaurants where the food and prices are consistent,
hotels prices and availability fluctuate wildly, so I don't believe in trying for specific hotels -
search and see what is good at that time.

I have on many occasions booked accommodation in the airport lounge minutes before boarding planes
but I do not recommend this.
I have have private hosts cancel my accommodations the day before or even the same day of my arrival
(see [Morocco](#morocco)).

It's annoying to be booking at the last minute because you'll get the least good places for the most expensive prices.

### Internet - Hotel vs Airbnb

Hotel wifi is probably the worst wifi ever,
often averaging around 10Mbit/s, sometimes 7Mbit/s, I've even recorded it as low at 2Mbit/s,
and they tend to have frequent random outages.

The slow speeds - especially throughput and latency variability - can ruin even your audio conference calls, never mind
your video conference calls, especially if you are forced to do them through a corporate Windows Virtual Desktop which
is far more network expensive and latency sensitive.

I have been bitten by this several times.

If Digital Nomadding, try to get out to a cafe with good internet for conference calls, and test their speeds (see the
doc [Network - Speed Test](networking.md#network-speed-test)).
If it's less than 20Mbit/s, find somewhere else.
I've observed good places having wifi speeds of even 70-90Mbit/s and almost no contention due to low number of users.

Internet in Airbnb is either good high speed broadband or broken entirely for the duration.

At one hotel in Thailand, the room wifi was broken the entire week I was there.
I had to sit in the lobby to use the wifi network there, as did others,
and sometimes even that didn't work due to having run out of IP addresses from their DHCP address pool -
a trivial problem to fix if they had even an average IT engineer on hand or over the phone.
I spent all week hassling the reception staff daily pleading to put one on the phone for me to tell them how to fix
it without success).
It still wasn't working when I left there.

Hostels tend to be nearer the hotel end of the wifi internet spectrum, but not usually as bad as hotels in my experience
as the younger crowd of hostels is much more internet dependent and they know this.

### Parking - Hotel, Hostel & Airbnb

If driving, make sure to double check parking at hotels or Airbnbs.

If Expedia shows `Parking Available` include of `Parking Included`, that means there will be parking charges,
which can be quite high.

You have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the hotel listing to find out what the charges are in the small print.

When driving, I often prefer booking places a bit away from the centers to get easier parking as many central
accomodations, both hotels and airbnbs lack good parking.

Also, if you're only going into the centres in the evenings, often you can get cheap or even free parking.

Hostels are usually more central and have no parking, so that's an extra challenge to find external parking locations if
driving, such as my European Summer Road Trip Tours.

### Hostel Tips

#### Lockers

Hostels usually have lockers for valuables (check thel listing before booking).

Some have lockers with a key, others expect you to have a padlock (which they can usually rent to you).

If using hostels repeatedly, get yourself a padlock with a key rather than combination lock,
because aside from the fact someone can just spend a few hours to try all combinations, when you're putting stuff away
late at night, it's must easier with a key than trying to do a combination in the dark with your phone light.

#### Towels

Some hostels provide towels, others rent them to you, and others don't provide them at all.

If using hostels repeatedly,
buy yourself a nice fluffy towel with a high thread count instead of renting them,
it'll work out cheaper in the long run anyway.

#### Shower Gel

At most hostels you will need to take your own shower gel.

#### Pillows

Pillows tend to not be great in hostels.

So in Europe where I road trip, which gives me greater flexibility and luggage capacity, I take my 2 memory foam
pillows.

One could make do with taking one good pillow, but if flying even this might take up valuable space and weight in your
checked luggage suitcase.

#### WorldPackers

You can use [WorldPackers](https://www.worldpackers.com/) to volunteer at hostels in exchange for free board,
which is a great way of seeing the world when young on budget.

## Taxis

Airport taxis are a rip off all over the world. Do not use them.

Use the taxi apps for the specific country,
which are listed below, underneath each country.

Compare the different apps to get the best price, it only takes 2 minutes.

Taxis in some countries only accept cash,
even when ordering them using apps, such as in Albania,
or the airport taxis in Moldova and Malaysia.

Taxis in Thailand and Malaysia stopped at ATMs to get me to withdraw cash for them.

See the [ATM and Foreign Cash Withdrawals](#atms-and-foreign-cash-withdrawals) section below.

## Wifi

### Wifi Hotels

Hotel wifi is often awful, in both signal reliability and speed, even at relatively nice hotels.

### Wifi Cafes & Restaurants

Preserve your mobile data and battery life by not using 4G/5G except when you have to,
always get on the cafe / restaurant wifi.

### Wifi Speeds

I have listed wifi speeds at various venues I've used to digital nomad around as I live on wifi.

_"X/Y Mbit wifi"_ shorthand means X Mbit/s download and Y Mbit/s upload eg.
50/30 means 50 Mbit/s download speed and 30Mbit/s upload speed, as tested using
[network speed test](networking.md#speedtestnet).

## Mobile Internet Access

Always ensure you have mobile internet before you leave the airport or cross the border by car / coach.

Use the airport wifi to set up one of your e-sims using the lists below, or sims at the airports.

On rare occasion I wasn't able to get airport wifi working, and that could be a problem so it's better to sort the e-sim
on the wifi of your departing airport before you take off than arrive at the other end.

### EU Roaming

If you're not an EU resident or don't have an EU sim, skip to the next section [Mobile e-Sims](#mobile-e-sims).

I've used my UK sim from [Smarty](https://smarty.co.uk) across all the EU countries I visited as it permits use of your
plan's bundled service within EU countries at no extra charge, and the monthly contract is cheap as chips.

Now that is progress!

- included calls
- included texts
- up to 12GB of your data plan
  - I actually increased my data plan because I used it for GPS everywhere, and didn't want
    to risk running out

There is a tweak you need to make to your phone to enable it for roaming:

<https://smarty.co.uk/roaming-setup>

which basically comes down to changing your Mobile Service data MMS APN to `mob.asm.net` in your phone settings.

My UK phone number worked across all European countries I travelled through, including:

- Austria
- Bulgaria
- Croatia
- Estonia
- France
- Germany
- Hungary
- Lithuania
- Latvia
- Poland
- Romania
- Sweden
- Slovakia
- Slovenia

It stopped working when I got to Serbia which is not in the EU.

Going from EU to non-EU was a bit of a jarring experience.

There may be something to the EU integration project after all.

### Mobile e-Sims

You can buy data plans for a certain number of days.

Follow the installation instructions and make sure to enable `Data Roaming`
under the e-sim settings otherwise the internet won't connect.

Prices fluctuate and alternate by country so compare the top 3 providers before choosing:

- [Nomad](https://www.getnomad.app/) - a bit cheaper than Airalo,, I've started using this the most
- [Airalo](https://www.airalo.com/) - I used this a lot originally, second cheapest option
- [AloSim](https://alosim.com/) - took a punt and used this for Bosnia as it was the cheapest there

Others:

- [Eskimo](https://www.eskimo.travel/en) - global data plans so you don't lose your remainder and can use it in other
  countries, but in my experience the price per GB is so much more experience that this isn't worth it
- [Holafly](https://esim.holafly.com/) - offers unlimited data but very expensive, usually not worth it given you typically don't use more
  than 1-3GB unless you're watching lots of videos on 4G instead of hotel wifi
- [Saily](https://saily.com/) - WARNING: I haven't use this one yet, but my travel buddy who also travels all year has found Saily to
  be unreliable and had to get refunds from them 3 times across different countries, and warned me not to use it

Not tried these:

- [sSim.sm](https://esim.sm/)
- [Gjirafa eSIM](https://travel.gjirafa.com/en/esim)

<!-- -->

- [Fonus](https://www.fonusmobile.com/) - unlimited worldwide mobile plans

<!-- -->

- [Silent.link](https://silent.link) - Pay-as-You-Go prepaid, anonymous (no KYC, no name or even email),
  pay in [Bitcoin](bitcoin.md) or other [Crypto](crypto.md), account balance doesn't expire,
  but the per GB data rates are higher, priced in USD, and can vary quite substantially even within the same country eg.
  in Thailand it may be \$1.32 on a couple networks and then over \$7 on the True Thailand network.
  The e-sims above usually work out cheaper.
  Get Silent Link as a backup non-expiring balance in case the airport wifi doesn't work to get your e-sim above set up
  or the e-sim loses reception provider and you need GPS for navigation or emergencies

Google [travel e-sims](https://www.google.com/search?q=travel+e-sims)
and add the country you are travelling to for more options.

### Conserve Mobile Data - Pre-Download Offline Google Maps, Translate & Spotify Playlists

Most of my data usage was caused by Google Maps and Spotify
(you can see this on iPhone under `Settings` -> `Mobile Service` further down the page).

Pre-cache your usage when on Wifi to avoid using up too much precious mobile e-sim data:

- Google Maps - download an offline map for your city or area under settings -  you need to keep Google Maps open until
  the download is complete
- Spotify - click the downloaded option on your playlists - by default this will only download on wifi
- Google Translate - download the language (the icon to the left of each language on the language selection drop down)

Give each time to complete and check their progress before setting out and leaving your wifi connection behind.

### International Calls using VoIP over the Internet

Because banks and other legacy providers will force you to call them, you can use one of these services:

- [Viber](https://account.viber.com/en/call-united-kingdom) - 1 week free trial, £5.99 afterwards for unlimited calls (or £1.79 for 100 mins a month),
  but again does not apply to premium or non-geographic numbers like banks often use,
  worked on Barclays number that MoreMins was not processing voice
- [MoreMins](https://www.moremins.com/) - quick, cheap and easy, has an app, £5 for 30 days of unlimited calls,
  use 0800 number to your bank, as premium / national numbers like banks are often using will incur high per-minute
  charges. Blocked me from using Barclays 0800 number. Possible bust option
- [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com/rates) - cheaper than Skype for national calls but hard to use as a foreigner,
  limited to 10 countries, need to use a [VPN](vpn.md) just to try to access it, disappointing usability
- [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/international-calls/) - £5 for 400 minutes, expensive for national numbers like most
  banks and businesses use

## ATMs and Foreign Cash Withdrawals

ATMs in some countries charge a flat fee of between £5-7 for any withdrawal amount -
Thailand, Cambodia, Croatia and Albania spring to mind.

This means it's better to estimate how much you need up front and make fewer larger withdrawals.

Do not use your Wise card to withdraw cash from ATM machines overseas - they charged me almost \$7 as an
_'ATM withdrawal fee'_... on top of the \$5 the Cambodian ATM charged me.

My bank by comparison charged me only the exchange rate, which was very close to accurate, I checked.

Obviously don't withdraw cash using credit cards, they'll likely have the worst / highest unscrupulous charges.

## Restaurants & Dining Out

Use [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com) (see [Mobile Internet Access](#mobile-internet-access) section).

Filter by:

- `Top Rated` on phone or `4.5+` Star rating on desktop
- Distance
- Price eg. `£, ££` or `£££` if it's date night
- Prefer restaurants with higher number of reviews to reduce likelihood of fake reviews swaying / gaming the system
- Places with soft piano music are upmarket (expensive)

Places just outside the centres are often better value for money and top quality food,
but some central places are great too.

Restaurants that close earlier are usually better foodie places, often with more reasonable prices. You'll often pay a
premium for places that are open later, because there are less rival choices open at that time.

I leave a couple recommendations in each location listed below.

Some places don't have English menus -
these are often the best places that aren't so spoilt by foreign money and tourist trap
churn allowing them to lower their standards.

You will need to use a [Translation App](#translation) ...

## Translation

If travelling to a non-English speaking country, I recommend downloading the
[Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/about/) app:

- Translates typed words
- Translates spoken words into typed words and immediately translates them
- Translates pictures replacing words into another language
  - uses Google Lens [AI](ai.md)

## Seasons - Timing Matters

Don't bother with Europe outside of June to August,
the weather is miserable 9 months out of the year and still awful even in late May, supposedly end of Spring,
as well as by September.

## Mosquito Repellent

Buy a good mosquito repellent if you're travelling anywhere near the Mediterranean, Asia or Africa -
I even got eaten in Belgium in summer time!

I find that cream works better than spray.

It is no fun being itchy all the time because these little bastards are biting you every day and night and leaving
lumps all over you.

And you can't feel them land to catch them and can never seem to kill enough of them.

You *need* mosquito repellent. Don't miss it.

## Beware Foreign Police & Customs

You may not understand how despicable institutional corruption is until you've had a first hand run-in with it.

I have been shaken down, fined or blackmailed by Police in countries ranging from South Africa to Latvia to Serbia,
had an
[invasive car search in Sweden](https://medium.com/@harisekhon/the-police-attention-you-get-driving-a-drug-dealer-looking-car-through-europe-d38c5919835f),
and was randomly stopped and questioned a couple times by the UK police on occasions I wore a hoodie
(with hood down during peak daytime 9am-2pm walking along the pavement slowly in broad daylight, not hiding my face).

<!-- TODO: link to medium article on random stop and search experiences -->

**Do not give the police any excuse to stop you.**

### Carry Your Official Documents Everywhere For When You _Are_ Stopped

Carry all of your documents on you safely in case you are stopped
(see [Driving](#driving) section checklist).

### Don't Speed

See the [Driving](#driving) section for more on this.

### Do Not Even Jaywalk

Do not walk across road crossings during red men pedestrian traffic signs as some countries have laws against
_"jay walking"_
which the police may choose
to only enforce against you as a foreigner etc. Some Police wait at major traffic light crossing
waiting for gullible foreigners to make this fineable mistake.

![Dont_trust_the_police](images/dont_need_gun_police_will_protect_you_thought_you_didnt_trust_police.jpeg)

**ps. don't carry guns to other countries! You will almost certainly get put in jail !!**

**pps. Don't even carry tools or anything remotely sharp.
I've even had my shaving razors taken off me at airports -
you never know how they will treat you in a foreign place and it varies significantly.**

## Driving

Ferries are surprisingly expensive, similar or more in price compared a plane ticket.

This probably works out a little more economical if having more than one person in the car.

You should book ahead of time due to limited slots, and for better pricing.

EU countries have town symbols along routes which automatically drop the speed limit to 50kmph whether they declare it
explicitly or not.

This is a local knowledge that will get you done and your license revoked if you hit 100kmph. See [Latvia](#latvia).

### Car Insurance

Car insurance often includes 30-90 days cover in Europe, check each provider for details.

**Beware: UK car insurance covers only EU countries and one or two others like Switzerland and Serbia, but NOT**
**Montenegro, Albania or North Macedonia.**

Not coincidentally these are 3 out of the 4 non-EU countries left in the Balkans
and for good reason as they are clearly the least developed countries.

**You will be forced by the police to buy expensive insurance at the border in those countries if you cannot prove you**
**have a specific insurance covering their country.**

### International Driving Insurance

- [Lobagola](https://www.lobagola-insurance.com/)
  - [Lobagola Balkans](https://www.lobagola-insurance.com/insurance/balkans.html)

#### Temporary Car Insurance Cover

These are relatively very expensive in my experience so I avoid them.

- [GoShorty](https://goshorty.co.uk/temporary-car-insurance/european-car-insurance/) - extremely expensive, £30-36 for
  3 hours!
- [TempCover](https://motor.tempcover.com/) - expensive, quoted me £273 for just 28 days
- [DayInsure](https://www.dayinsure.com/)

### Driving Checklist

Police may refuse you entry or blackmail you out of money if you don't have all of the following documents:

- Passport:
  - South African police laid a trap pulling over foreigners coming out of
    [Sandton](#sandton) - primarily a rich foreigner area.
    My guess is they were targeting rental cars in an attempt to extort fines / bribes from foreigners not carrying
    their passports and even document imaginable including driving license and international driver's permit.
    <!-- TODO: medium story this full exchange -->
- UK driver's license
- International driver's permit (get this from the Post Office it's only around £5 but requires a passport photo)
- Insurance certificate
  - check it covers the specific country, see note above that non-EU countries are often not covered
- Vehicle Registration V5C paper proof of ownership
  - [Serbian](#serbia) police refused to accept digital proof of ownership via insurance certificate
  - they insisted on physical original paper copy
  - they said it was the equivalent to *"Passport for the car"*

### Additional EU Driving Checklist

Driving in the EU additionally requires:

- breakdown kit (AA does one), including:
  - high viz jacket (which must be available in the passenger compartment
  - breakdown triangle
  - headlamp converters

Headlamp converters are basically headlamp stickers that change the glare direction of your headlamps to shine the other
way because you drive on the right in Europe instead of the left like in the UK.

Apparently the French police are likely to pull you over and fine you if you don't have these.

### EU Motorway Tolls

Socialist Europeans find extra ways to tax you
and you need to buy motorway passes when driving in several European countries or face fines.

There are automated cameras so you are likely to get hit with fines if you don't buy one of these in advance.

See here for some details of which countries and prices.

<https://www.autoeurope.com/travel-tips/vignette-stickers/>

Specific countries purchase apps and websites are listed under each country.

### Do Not Speed

Do not speed, you only need to go a meagre 50kmh above the speed limit and the [Latvian](#latvia) police will revoke
your license.

This is easy to do in towns which are set to only 50kmph speed limits whether they explicitly declare it or not.

If you see a car pushing into the back of you, do not speed up.

It may be a police car that will only put on its siren after you've increased speed to breach the +50kmph maximum
penalty of €360 euros and a revoked license.

The extended time pulled over by the police not knowing if they are going to arrest you and impound your vehicle on top
of revoking your license will set you back a lot more time than any speed up would give you.

It's quite possible they do this on purpose 15 minutes from the Estonia border to catch unsuspecting foreigners driving
between the countries.

Let cars overtake you than fall for this unmarked police car entrapment.

### Parking

Use [Parkopedia](https://www.parkopedia.com/) to find parking and see its pricing up front to not get ripped off.
Occasionally the parking might be slightly more expensive than Parkopedia's latest knowledge.

There are apps for Parkopedia for iPhone and Android.

In the Parkopedia app, once you've selected the car park you can, share it to Waze to plan the journey there.

Do not use Waze to get to the city and then try to find parking, that's more difficult, and Waze will often send you to
some random part of a city, which has little there.

## EU Schengen Visa Calculator

I use a Google Sheets spreadsheet with formulas but this is also helpful.

This is easy to use as you just have to click your entry / exit dates:

<https://schengenareacalculator.com/>

This is less easy to use because you have to manually enter the dates:

<https://www.visa-calculator.com/>

## Emigration

### Taxes

Brits leaving in the middle of a UK tax year (April 6th - April 5th next year) will have a declare a split tax year to
HMRC.

It's best to plan ahead and leave just before April 5th to not contaminate another next tax year with HMRC able to claim
tax off you that quite frankly the UK doesn't deserve at this point.

Read this article on [my Medium](https://medium.com/@harisekhon) for more:

[Tax Advice for Emigrating or Going Digital Nomad](https://medium.com/@harisekhon/tax-advice-for-emigrating-or-going-digital-nomad-c100fba461ed)

### Mail Redirection

Brits may want to [redirect their mail overseas](https://www.postoffice.co.uk/mail/redirection) or
get a [PO Box](https://www.royalmail.com/receiving/po-box) to collect on return visits.

-->

### Serbia

I used the [Airalo](https://www.airalo.com/) e-sim data only for $14 for 5GB valid for 30 days.

On subsequent visits I've used the [Nomad](https://www.getnomad.app/) e-sim
as it was cheaper - 1GB or 3GB for £3.38 or £6.76, respectively.

#### Indoor Smoking, Outdoor Smoking, Smoking Everywhere in Serbia

It is still legal to smoke indoors in Serbia.

This really isn't the EU.

Unfortunately people seem to smoke a lot in Serbia.
I've changed tables while dinning outdoors at al fresco restaurants, only to have someone else then start smoking next
to me at another table.

I've moved indoor tables to escape from smokers,
and even cut short a coffee evening in frustration with people chain-smoking nearby due to getting fed up with all the
smoke inside the coffee shop.

You have to feel sorry for the Serbian wait staff subjected to second-hand smoke all day every day at work.

Quite shocking that Serbia permits this.

I've asked the locals about this and they said there are a couple non-smoking venues *"but nobody goes there"*.

#### Taxis in Serbia

- [Car Go](https://appcargo.com/en) - like Uber. Usually the cheapest but wait times seem much longer than advertised, and sometimes it didn't
  find any drivers, so I had to use Yandex Go or Pink Taxi below instead
- [Yandex Go](https://go.yandex/) - a bit pricier than Car Go but seems to have more drivers
- [Pink Taxi](https://pinktaxi.info/) - has mixed reviews, but it worked
- Lux Taxi app couldn't even register using my UK mobile number - I got
  [this error](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/harisekhon_imagine-having-a-top-taxi-app-in-belgrade-activity-7242252581597585409-MRlJ) 🤪

#### Driving in Serbia

It took over **3 hours** to get through the Hungarian - Serbian border.

I asked a guy in the queue of cars in front of me and he said 3-4 hours was common.

**IMPORTANT** - Make sure you have every document possible including your vehicle registration otherwise the Serbian police
will either refuse to let you in or blackmail you out money. Don't ask me how I know this.

See the [Driving Checklist](#driving-checklist) above.

I also saw several people pulled over by Serbian police.

Be wary of Serbian police. *"You are not in the EU now"* as they said to me.

Overall, a horrible experience driving to Serbia and I would not do it again.

You immediately feel like you've gone from Europe to some dangerous 3rd world country where you are more worried about
the police themselves and corruption.

My car also broke down - the battery was a right-off after leaving it in storage for 7 months.
Even buying an overpriced Noco boost charger for £150 (at 40% above UK price) and emptying its charge into it twice
didn't  work, and nor did jump cabling from a truck.

#### Belgrade

##### Buses in Belgrade & Nikola Tesla Airport

Buses became free in Belgrade in 2025!!!

Except for the A1 bus to / from the airport which costs 400 rsd (Serbian dinars)...
around €3.40 - but you don't need to take the A1 bus, you can take the 600 or 607 buses to / from Nikola Tesla airport.
As you come out of the airport arrivals lounge on the lower level (departures is upper level), the bus stop is literally
outside the door, even closer than the taxies across the street...

...and if you do want to take a taxi, remember to never take tourist trap taxis outside airports as they're usually
twice the price. See the [Taxis in Serbia](#taxis-in-serbia) section above for the taxi apps.

My travel buddy rode the buses all day around Belgrade when he discovered this and then took me to a bigger mall on the
outskirts.

<!--

##### Hostels in Belgrade

I like:

- [Habitat Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sfZpNsEL7KoKLGtH7) - cheap £10 per night and they have a big dog
- [Nomad Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4J9Hbi1jKe44jE117) - cheap and central on
  [Skadarlija](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EmubAYnEWMkfSW1T7) which means it is noisy in the evenings until they close the
  windows, but has privacy curtains on the lower bunks and a good kitchen area

TODO:

- [Balkan Soul Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e5boYR2CavZtF5Bo7)
- [Good People Hostel ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/faWhbVnstLj3hWii6) - liked by my travel buddy and a girl I met
  travelling who stayed there
- [The Traveling Theater Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qo6NaCErN38HTY8K7)
- [Pop Art Rooms](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hUHokqpm8vAknrZh6) - a little more expensive but very stylist interior and
  near Belgrade Waterfront
- [Hostelche](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9Ez4iVwZdn8dZ1jD9)

**Not Recommended:**

- [Hidden Gem Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/52LY2TqBehMoLTmq6) - my travel buddy tried it, said it was too small and
  that he preferred Good People Hostel above

-->

##### Restaurants in Belgrade

The capital is reasonable in the center. Overall it is slightly cheaper to dine than other European cities.

The top end of the range is typically comparable to other european cities.

The lower end is typically about half that.

- [Street Pasta Bar - Sremska](https://maps.app.goo.gl/woUhBnmt8973aEqH7) - is my top pick here - cheap, fresh juices,
  good wifi and young crowd (probably due to it being cheap).
  I've spent many hours on their wifi with regular top ups of juices and smoothies because they're so affordable,
  on top of lunch and dinner.
  Closes earlier than other restaurants at 9pm so it's better as a daytime place.
  Non-smoking, a rare find in Belgrade.
  There is a second one of these but it's not as good as it used to be because they moved and have a smaller venue with
  less good road window / lighting
- [Elephant's Food House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aK24TL7T6c3cm3xKA) - another good cheap lunch type place.
  Closes early at 6pm
- [Zendwich](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e4jXMpjC6Fqb2WFW9) - asian restaurant, good food and reasonable prices,
  a mix South Korean & Japanese cuisine styles.
  The flank steak ciabatta has good quality meat with kimchi and is only 1250rsd (€10.50)
- [PRANA Brunch & More](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1pJSNozw9625KRYA7) - all day brunch until 7-8pm the, with the usual
  gentrified type of brunch food - fresh juices and smoothies,
  variations of avocado toast, eggs on foccacia or sourdough toast, oatmeal / acai / granola bowls.
  The the juice was a decent size [for Europe!] for 420rsd (€3.50 - 2/3 the price of the tourist trap places in the
  centre), and the proscuitto & goats cheese on avocado spread toast, with roasted
  red pepper and toasted almonds were quite good, but then it should be for 940rsd (€8).
  Wifi 9/5 Mbit/s outside
- [Thyme - StreetCuisine & Cocktails](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DKEt6dwnfTToc9K17) - upmarket (pricey) top 25 restaurant
  in Belgrade, prime location on the side street just off the main high street, opposite the Rajićeva Shopping Center
  and next to the Kalemegdan park and Belgrade fortress.
  Expect to pay €20-30 per head + drinks.
  The truffle burger, called the "By chefs" burger, comes with caramelized onion, truffle butter slab, pecorino cheese
  (like parmesan) which is grated in front of you.
  I didn't notice any pistachios in it as per the menu though.
  The truffle burger is also quite a premium at 1700rsd (€15) for just the burger, 1.7x the price of the regular burger,
  and it's not very big, leaving space for dessert!
  The crispy fries were light and crispy, and heavily salted, which made them taste very good.
  The Tanasko steak main in the specials section was interesting, it appeared smaller than expected, but hit the spot
  with 4 good quality short thick slices of katsu-sando sirloin steak served medium-rare with each piece on its side,
  sandwiched with thin white bread and an orange sauce of homemade sriracha. It has a chilli symbol next to it but was
  not spicy.
  The accompanying sides also appeared small, with 3 glazed spring onions and 4 triple fried potato chunky fries -
  honestly it would have been better if they'd added more of these as they were very good to dunk in the orange sauce.
  The orange juice and mixed juice were good but unfortunately very small at 0.25l, seems more like 0.2l, tiny, not sure
  if worth it, or you'd have to order two of them.
  - Desserts - of the three desserts I've tried, this is the order in which I rank them:
    - The _"Juicy, Fruity, Exotic"_ dessert was a very good fine dessert, small but full of flavours - a lime cake with thin
  base, held in by a a white chocolate side, topped by 2 meringue bars and a small opal shaped multivitamin ice cream,
  and passionfruit and mint sauce.
    - The _"Creamy, Milky, Coconut"_ dessert is basically a rice pudding with caramel on top and coconut flakes -
  it's very good - eat it vertically for best results.
    - The poppy seed cake has a half cm thick layer of chocolate on top and a small vanilla ice cream scoop on it - this was
     my least favourite for the three desserts.
  Google Maps says the kitchen is open until 11pm but in reality only 10:45pm and by 10:40pm they would only serve a
  burger and not any of the specialities.
    - TODO: also try the ice cream with pistachio glaze and raspberry ice cream...
  Wifi 10/13 Mbit/s
  - [Thyme](https://thyme.rs/) has two other restaurants with even better menus but they are further out:
    - [Thyme - StreetFood & Breakfast, Karađorđeva](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Es1kENwE6dW3zFy97)
    - [Thyme - StreetFood & Breakfast, Kirovljeva](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6gup2bvsC4w8zUdR8)
- [Kafeterija Magazin 1907](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PwaZbmMLMU7zTr1Z6) - good coffee shop with 2 levels right in the
  centre, often busy and open late until 11pm - the have extensive menus of drinks,
  including fresh pressed juices and smoothies including acai,
  protein etc, as well as acai / moat / chia bowls, all day eggs breakfasts, as well as burgers, sandwiches, wraps and
  salads.
  The acai smoothie was 600rsd (€5) but was a good size,
  much bigger than the 350ml compared other venues ml sizes like Thyme.
  Kitchen closes just before 10pm.
  TODO: try the Acai and other bowls
  Wifi is capture portal with 5/5 Mbit/s speed
- [Перло бургери (Perlo's Burger)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/etkwZ4JAMwTLbLhh7) - highly rated gentrified small burger
  restaurant facing Republic Square.
  I can't believe it took my 4th trip to Belgrade to find this place which has a 4.9 Google rating!
  The signature Perlo burger is not big, but good quality with truffle aoli sauce.
  The fries with spice dusting aren't a big portion either, the spice is a 5 mix and not spicy, more like orange salt.
  They don't have cutlery so be prepared to get your hands dirty in true fast food fashion.
  This is probably the best fast food you'll have in Belgrade.
  Wifi is only 0.5/0.5 Mbit/s
- [Bege Sendviči](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CTzVcJZg3QVDFM369) - cheap late night good quality, choose 4 meats in a
  sandwich and have it toasted for only 390rsd (€3) - hard to beat this. Good stop for protein after going to Street Gym
- [Brusnica](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BokB17u66mckEd8DA) - relatively expensive health food restaurant in buzzing evening
  location on the Obilićev venac bar strip just off Republic Square in the center - you're paying for the location.
  It has with fresh juices, acai bowls, eggs breakfasts, avocado toast, chia and oats, fruits, salads with
  protein add-ons like chicken, salmon, bacon, nuts, seeds etc. as well as cheesecake desserts and cocktails.
  A bit pricier for fresh squeezed juices than say Street Pasta Bar, but open later as they didn't do me a juice at 8pm.
  The tropical acai bowl is not what one would expect,
  it's more like a dessert with chocolate and many other things in it -
  this is a sugar treat even more than a regular acai bowl.
  This place refuses to split group bills so you might want to bring cash if in a group.
  Wifi 10/7 Mbit/s
- [Boutique #1](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mxsz6q5hFQfJEDhj8) - prime location restaurant overlooking Republic Square -
  good for drinks but also has food and a good looking dessert menu.
  Unfortunately it's a bit expensive at €5-6 for a juice.
  Wifi 15/0.5 Mbit/s outside
- [Boutique #2](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1svhc4v3bq3aAwfh7) - prime location sister restaurant to Boutique 1 on the main
  high street at the Belgrade Fortress end for drinks or food on the main parade, very popular and good menu.
  Open late until 12-1am this is one of the latest places open on the main high street
- [Trattoria Pepe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gdP9dLWxAVzGYEdV6) - excellent Italian 5 minutes walk from the centre - worth the walk
- [Kafana Suvobor](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PqQ4iuStYhSz1EnGA) - good Serbian restaurant in the district the locals eat,
  5 minutes walk off the main high street.
  The bread came warm and combined with the ajvar red pepper dip starter was decent.
  The peppers in oil was a different flavour and also worth trying, 3 large red peppers with garlic.
  From the barbequeue menu we had skipped the cevapi as it's just minced meat which is lower quality meat,
  and went with the solid meat pork skewers instead, which came with 2 skewers.
  However, my favourite pick at this restaurant is the veal sausages, and I don't normally rate sausages but these were
  full of flavour, I would go back just for these.
  The Baklava dessert was decent, better than the "venison" chocolate cake, the latter of which I would skip next time
- [Hotel Moskva](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UBCTFmgQWfztRtESA) - fresh juices, fine desserts, go for an afternoon drink /
  dessert
- [Orasac (Орашац)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/D9ok9vaHDVjJceWp7) - the "karadordeva snicla" pork wrapped around cheese and
  coated in breadcrumbs was the best thing we had by far.
  The beef goulash with mashed potato, and other pork dish we had was reasonable too.
  They also have fresh squeezed orange juice.
  Kitchen closes at 10:30pm
- [Curry Souls in Galerija Male](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YRvKTri4nMXrpHs98) - outdoor terrace seating oversees the
  Belgrade Waterfront - the chicken thigh curry was good,
  as was the side cucumber and pineapple salad side add-on (although it is small).
  Wifi 6/25 Mbit/s outdoors on terrace
  - [Curry Souls in Obilićev venac](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jEzrzNh75eYhzYdG8) - is just off the main high street and
    has good outdoor seating for summer, with the same menu
- [Oskar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xtbibPCagq1qP5jCA) - good quality restaurant, a few minutes off the beaten track
  (usually better finds because they survive on foot and not tourist trap). 43/31 Mbit/s wifi
- [Burger House Bros Centar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C5FyhgFp16gPN11H9) - very good burger restaurant
- [Casa Nova](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mPPNKEYf2M5FKnm49) - has both outdoor and a non-smoking section on the upper level
  rear section (quiet section, everybody in Belgrade seems to smoke)
- [Velika Skadarlija](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jHfCipxrNiK4Bzg66) - good restaurant with great outdoor seating area, with
  the odd plug if you need it
- [Restoran Kosmaj](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9QK4fMvPjWVTVyZW7) - on the main road, but the food was good
  eg. beef goulash with mash was decent, less salty than Oskar but a bit more fat on the beef. 12/2 Mbit/s wifi
- [Burgos - Premium Burger Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PHEvHFbcsdyYANvb7) - good quality but burger bar.
  “Serbian gourmet” burger came stacked 4inches tall for 840rsd (€7), and the fries were skinny but hot and fresh for
  240rsd (€2). The sweet potato fries were also good for 320rsd (€2.70). The dips are charged but good sized portions,
  I had the honey-mustard and chipotle-mayo which were both very good, I polished them off and every bite of all the
  food. Wifi 7/6 Mbit/s
- [Smash Burgers](https://maps.app.goo.gl/38WxX9dnwcSn67Pq7) - fast food, for £7.50 for a burger and fries without a
  drink, should perhaps have got a proper restaurant meal for £9 instead.
  The burger was very fast food, fries were mediocre,
  but the Habanero SOS sauce for dipping the fries was amazing (of course it was, it contains sugar),
  although getting the staff to give me a dish to put the sauce in was a challenge.
  The wifi worked at the bar but not at the main seating bench so no speed test here
- [URA! Russian dumplings](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tbNvia8txHUUNqim6) - best Russian dumplings in Belgrade apparently
- [Obilićev venac road](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kLPuPNVYTPoscB3v6) - tourist trap road full of restaurants just off the
  main square, trade prices for buzziness
  - [Hari's Creperie](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jph8LKEq9Cv8HkpTA) - sweet & savory crepes, pizza, salads, all day
    breakfast menu even including full english breakfast.
    The Hari's Special salad is an interesting mix of salad and fruit,
    but has perhaps too many raisins, so not died food.
    Decent but pricey due to the location. Only 5/1 Mbit/s wifi
  - [Choco Caffe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V5uHT5oQBejE7Y4c8) - on tourist trap street but decent, there is live music
    across the road which is plenty loud enough while sitting outside
  - [Stamevski](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jQYhSot45w6J3rTa8) - dessert restaurant with amazing looking cakes, has pistachio
    milkshake, although very fattening version. Wifi was slow as hell at 0.3/0.05 Mbit/s
- [Franš](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2Nw5ZndZ5h1Z8JGS8) - popular upmarket restaurant - if you want to know where rich
  people come to eat, it’s here.
  It has nice outdoor sheltered seating, good for summer.
  The food is reasonably decent, but not the best, and it's quite expensive.
  The cars parked in front were alternating Mercedes and Range Rovers, maybe the odd custom matt BMW SUV.
  I was surprised how busy it was on a Tuesday afternoon, and many women put on dresses to dine here, even on a Tuesday
  afternoon. These seem like the landlord class families who don't work.
  The smoked klobasa (sausages) were good,
  and if in doubt you can order the Homemade Frans Platter which is 6 different meats with a side of french fries
  (I swapped mine for roasted sliced potatoes).
  The perch fillets of fish is recommended from the seafood section.
  The sour cherry pie and ice cream in melon desserts were nothing special and I would skip them next time.

- [Protein Global 1](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hXKbairSDSifnXmB9) - good menu, juices, smoothies,
  protein shakes, eggs breakfasts (until 2pm), protein oatmeal, burgers, pasta, steaks, salads, these guys have it all.
  On a side street but people still find it.
  The Ranch Eggs with turkey is like scrambled egg whites with turkey pieces, red bell pepper, tomato and spring onion,
  not the most exciting dish, but healthy and proteiny.
  I didn't like the protein pancakes though,
  they compromised far too much on flavour to try to keep them protein healthy,
  not worth it, and were quite difficult to get through.
  When you fancy pancakes, this is not what you expect -
  get normal pancakes at a normal place, you can't have everything at the same time.
  The detox smoothie was a bit more bitter than expected,
  but the 3 mixed juice (I chose orange, apple and pineapple) was nice and sweet and for 440rsd (€3.75) 300ml unlike
  other european places giving only 200ml.
  Wifi 148/23 Mbit/s.
  [Protein Global 2](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BiMRhL4MFio9dCqk6) is further out
- [Fit Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/S6nsPw9Ckj9v34Jg8) - small healthy eat place, chocolate protein porridge is good on
    the breakfast menu but the Energizer shake is my favourite here that keeps me coming back. One of the rare no smoking
    places in Belgrade. There are a couple of popular bars next door to here too.
    Don't get the protein shake to take away though,
    their takeaway cups are small 0.3l instead of the 0.4l glasses when you have it locally.
    Both local and takeaway juice portions are smaller
    than they used to be in 2024 as they now come in pre-pressed tiny bottles of 290ml,
    even smaller than quoted on the menu.
    I don't come here as much as I used to as a result now.

- [Ćevap kod Dekija](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9tzTUWr9Pc6UvsiS9) - overrated. The spicy sausages were mostly fatty bits,
  the minced meat cevap rolls were squishy and the bunless Serbian burger was the least bad part with some onions mixed
  in. Should have gone to Burger House Bros instead and gotten a proper meat burger.
  This was so bad I left a lot of the sausages and the cevap, and went to FitBar for a protein shake instead.

#### Novi Sad

Good central district of restaurants.

Cheaper Airbnbs as 1.5 hour drive from Belgrade.

- [Petrus Caffe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1sZJoLAsLn5Vkq6m8) - excellent restaurant, very popular with large outdoor

#### Nis

Southern city on the way from Belgrade to Sofia, Bulgaria.

- [Distrikt cafe&bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DvvaWn7zjj2PTtp66) - nice decor, good selection of drinks, fresh juices,
  breakfasts, oatmeal special, burgers, pizza, pasta, mains, desserts.
  The chocolate cherry protein oatmeal was decent, but very calorie rich so I didn't finish it.
  The "lime time" juice mix containing lime, orange, apple, pineapple juice was good and freshly made
- [Kod Rajka](https://maps.app.goo.gl/U3grzPEDWyktKjNW8) - good serbian restaurant. The chicken in mushroom sauce is big
  and all chicken. The sopska salad (tomato, cucumber and onion, covered in shredded feta, is very good). The orange
  juice was sold out, and the homemade lemonade was just squeezed lemon, probably worth skipping that next time.

### Singapore

This city state is one of the most developed places in Asia and one of the most expensive cities in the world.

This is another former British colony, like UAE, that has retained English speaking and UK 3-pin (type "G") plugs.

The food is more expensive and less good than the rest of Asia, and the hotels are expensive too.

Keep your visit short - 2-3 days should be enough to see the centre.

It's hard for me to give many recommendations here as I didn't stay long and wasn't impressed with the food at most
places (my friend who lived in Singapore for 10 years did warn me that the food there wasn't great).

- [Din Tai Fung](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6qjPc9t86kmGZRF78) - Taiwanese chain with a good array of noodle soups and
  dumplings (both savory and sweet, and mochi). The prawn & pork dumplings are good, you can have them as dumplings or
  as wontons in the spicy sesame sauce which is slightly spicey but not too much. It does not come as a soup, but as
  noodles in a base sauce with the dumplings, very yummmy
- [Poulet + Brasserie - ION Orchard](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ESLenpPGBj9GP3Pm6) - the quarter chicken with mash and
  french onion rice was good - think of it like a french Nandos without spice
- [Black Tap Craft Burgers & Beers](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f7kycwaSj1gj4rYw8) - same chain as in Dubai Mall, decent
  burgers at gentrified prices

I __don't__ recommend:

- [Collins](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RicdTvwnQSzVG1zE7) at Marina Square - wasn't impressed with the Wagyu steak.
  The fries were ok though, and the watermelon feta balsamic salad was good
- [Saizeriya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ibx8L9VYLS45mLaP8) - very low quality chain restaurant - it was the first place I
  tried in Singapore and was sorely disappointed - it's cheap but not worth wasting one of your day's meals on in my
  opinion. I found very little meat in the bolognese and the garlic focaccia was small and much less good than I'd
  imagined as that's a hard thing to get wrong. IMO it was the worst food I've eaten in Asia

### Slovakia

#### Motorway Tolls - e-Vignettes in Slovakia

Buyt this before using the motorways driving around Slovakia.

Use the official site rather than resellers, it's cheaper:

<https://eznamka.sk/selfcare/purchase>

#### Bratislava

Bratislava is nowhere near as big as Budapest, you probably don't need more than 3 nights here.

- [Urban House](Urban House) - very popular highly rated bar restaurant. The truffle roasted chicken was good - it comes
  with truffle potatoes au gratin, glazed carrots, green aparagus, truffle sauce, portobello mushrooms and fresh
  truffle. The Buffalo & Hot Honey pizza was even better, with prosciutto ham,
  buffalo chilli honey, burrata, pumpkin seeds, mozarella, jalapeno, pomodoro, capers and parmesan.
  The desserts were really good too - the pinacolada cake was excellent, with pineapple,
  coconut, yuzu, mango, Malibu, white chocolate, vanilla.
  The jasmine mango cheesecake was great too, with white chocolate, mango and passionfruit
- [Le Papillon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qnf4XpgV5PNMQqoR6) - excellent good menu and moderate prices, especially
  considering the prime location on one of the main strip. Popular, good ambience, music, decor, indoor and outdoor
  seating. Food is modern Slovak fusion, rather than traditional,
  means many dishes with flair, home made sauces, sauteed meats, great healthy options like fancy salads, drinks etc.
  The chicken steak with sweet potatoes, bacon-onion chutney and herb chilli pesto and fig was great.
  TODO: try the beef bowl with egg, and chicken bowl with salad, mango and pomegranate.
  Excellent light meals perhaps in between other meals. 911/47 Mbit/s wifi
- [Buny Bakery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cyQYGzUTbhYdreQd8) - truffle eggs benedict with ham was surprisingly good,
  although could have been bigger, and it should be good for €13!
  The bacon benedict for €12 is also really good, although similar to the truffle eggs benedict, could be bigger.
  The kitchen closes at 15:50 unfortunately, had on my second visit I had to have the foccaccia serano ham from the
  counter display, which while fancy looking, lacks much nutritional substance as it's mainly bread, and probably isn't
  worth €8. 356/42 Mbit/s wifi
- [Koliba Kamzík Zelená](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PrcVvnPB4wbVgqaSA) - upmarket restaurant on a side street so less of a
  tourist trap.
  The garlic soup with smoked cheese and herb croutons is a traditional cesnecka soup,
  which is common in Czechia too.
  My friend had the pork belly and didn't rate it though.
  I don't recommend getting pork belly anywhere as it is fatty.
  It came quickly and was pretty good, although I've had better, such as in my czech restaurant pick in Warsaw.
  Beef sirloin with bacon on creamy vegetable sauce comes with 2 large homemade streamed dumplings filled with
  cranberries. Wifi network "Aplend" is open with 94/10 Mbit/s speed
- [Otto](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C7CUXnotEU7mm6aK7) - serves breakfast until 3pm. The eggs benedict comes with homemade
  ham and a mildly mustard hollandaise sauce, which was all very good. 6/8 Mbit/s wifi
- [Mondieu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dwtCzwTZmc2TAdS28) - upmarket cafe restaurant chain with outdoor seating overlooking
  the river, good menu of breakfasts, mains, smoothies, and even acai bowl.
  Kitchen closes 1 hour before and breakfast is only served until 11:30 weekdays and 12:30 weekends unfortunately.
  9/2 Mbit/s wifi outside. Most venues in Bratislava, as well as Prague and Dubai
- [Bratislava Flagship Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RwJ5kwom3JpC2pFY9) - very busy commercial tourist restaurant
  with nice historic decor in the main upper floor of restaurant.
  Prices are a bit high eg. €19 for the duck leg with cabbage, and a very small side salad of tomatoes, cucumber and
  peppers was €4.
  The cesnakovy (garlic soup)is decent, with lots of cheese at the bottom,
  although not much soup volume, only 330ml, and comes in a mug with 2 sided handle, and only 2 small slices of bread.
  There is a version served in a whole bread bowl.
  Tables are mostly not reservable and given to walk-ins.
  The restaurant's wifi network isn't found in the top level,
  VisitBratislava was found instead but wouldn't connect due to weak signal.
  The top level has large long benches
  where tour guides lead in old insuffferable American tourist groups from places like California
  (you know the type, boomers that have parasited the wealth out of the new generations via asset inflation).
  The restaurant closes at 10pm but the kitchen closes at 9:30pm
- [Eggstro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xZcXH3jG4xFcXPTm8) - has no poached eggs, apparently everybody is asking for them.
  I had the scrambled eggs on toast with avocado and smoked salmon, but I thought the portion size wasn't large.
  Stunningly fast 710/52 Mbit/s wifi
- [Tsuki - Asian food & Sushi & Poke & Cafe Viet Nam](https://maps.app.goo.gl/12Cq6FHdQdNudSAVA) - 2 restaurants in one,
  the Salmon Poke bowl was really good. They weren't on the menu I saw which was full of sushi, but I asked the waiter
  for it after seeing it on Google Maps. 47/8 Mbit/s wifi

#### Kosice

Small city with a nice historic centre, but none of the venues I tried impressed me.

Would try [Slavia](https://www.kaviarenslavia.sk/jedalny-listok/) if I were to visit gain.

### Slovenia

#### Taxis in Slovenia

- [Bolt](https://bolt.eu/)
- [Wizi](https://wizi.si/)
- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/si/en/)
- [Hopin Taxi](https://www.hopin.si/)
- [Metro Taxi Ljubljana](https://www.metro.si/)

#### Motorway Tolls - Vignettes in Slovenia

You must purchase a vignette for using Slovenia's motorways, you can buy them online here:

<https://www.gov.si/en/topics/tolls/>

Alternatively you can buy them at the border by taking the other lane for it. Save time, buy it online.

#### Wifi in Slovenia

Slovenia has surprisingly bad wifi in many places ranging from the hostel to coffee shops and restaurants,
it is painfully slow and unreliable.

Do not stay at Hostel Tivoli again, the wifi didn't work a lot of the time.

If you do stay at Hostel Tivoli,
walk through the park to the centre, it's a much nicer walk and shaded most of the way by trees.

#### Ljubljana

**No Grocery Store Alcohol after 9pm!**

Many young people have the smart idea of buying cheap alcohol at the grocery store and drinking in the lovely park but
beware that even grocery stores open later until 10pm like [Mercator](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AgYuahno5jAfhyEM6) will
not sell alcohol to you past 9pm.
I believe this is a government regulation to force you to pay the tourist trap bars!
... which means more tax revenue for government too.
You don't hate the government enough. :wink:

- [Wonderland](https://maps.app.goo.gl/p5TD6eByJPzzmAft7) - in "Hotel Center", I walked past it and struggled to find
  it following Google Maps, but worth the find.
  A perfect Instagrammable place with excellent decor and great menu full of fancy drinks, desserts, all day brunch with
  eggs, acai and oatmeal bowls, pistacchio specials, "Instagrammable Coffees" eg. Ferrero Rocher coffee or pistacchio
  coffee with rims of pistacchios or other nuts, the wonder mocha looks amazing, a full range of cocktails and
  mocktails, salads and main courses.
  The classic breakfast (€12) is my preferred breakfast here, with 3 sunny side up fried eggs, 2 bacon rashers, 3 small toasts and mushrooms.
  The Eggs Royale with salmon was good too, and the extra poached egg for €2.30 wasn't really necessary
  as it's a decent amount of food.
  The Eggs Benedict doesn't come with ham so it's a bit basic,
  for €1 difference it's better to go with the Eggs Royale and get some salmon,
  or else the classic breakfast with bacon and 3 eggs.
  The Acai bowl is rich, cold, with frozen berries, granola and heart biscuits.
  Wifi 6/4 Mbit/s
- [Barbarella Juice Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/11iGQAXvdURCNM9B6) - fresh juices, smoothies, sandwiches, salads, soup,
  acai smoothie / oat / yoghurt bowls. Wifi is open but slow 2/0.2 Mbit/s. Closes at 8pm so get there early
- [R&B Cafe Roasters](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Sbg5YAFzo3xGMkxP9) - gentrified coffee shop, with a name like this you
  just have to visit it. Closes at 6pm.
  The Acai bowl comes deep but not wide so has a moderate amount of fruit toppings, granola and almond flakes.
  The Acai bowl at Barbarella is better though, in both toppings and richness with a deeper darker purple. No Wifi!
- [Patron Tacos & Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gGj3kgaThCyAD8wo8) - popular tacos restaurant with reasonable prices and
  nice outdoor seating, inside with stool seating, outdoor benches probably aren't great for winter.
  The horchata drink (€4) is really nice, a sweet coconut milk drink with a cinnamon stick in it,
  and comes in a good size (400ml?) unlike a lot of juice drinks here which are often a meagre 2dl (200ml).
  The fried white fish taco (€5.50) comes absolutely loaded, you will struggle to not drop pieces all over your plate.
  The shrimp taco (€5.50) is smaller and seriously spicy - they apologise on the menu that they cannot make it less
  spicey, probably because the chilli paste covering the shrimp is already made.
  Two tacos were plenty of food for me, they made a mistake and brought me 2 fish tacos instead of 1 shrimp one,
  so when they brought me the missing shrimp one I ended up with 3 tacos
  and couldn't finish the spare white fish taco anyway.
  Overall good value for money compared to other places in the city, and a contender for the best €15 I spent in
  Ljubljana. Wifi 9/8 Mbit/s
- [Pop's Place Burger Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pbmCcioYuthJ73Va8) - good burgers, not too big.
  The fries with herbs and parmesan has a lot of grated parmesan on it, totally worth it.
  The homemade lemonade with ginger is good but not sweet. Wifi 39/8 Mbit/s
- [Le Petit Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zyFidPCx2SHuYSYC6) - popular restaurant with good outdoor seating. Breakfast
  menu ends at 12pm though so get there early.
  The eggs royale with salmon is decent but not too big since it's only the 2 topped muffins comes with nothing on the
  side. Could have eaten two of them.
  Wifi 1.8/0.8 Mbit/s
- [Slovenska Hiša - Figovec](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VYKV7YAM4BFZyRLRA) - service was very slow to seat, 4 staff members
  walked past and ignored me and the crowd of people that developed behind me queuing at the door for about 10 minutes,
  until one of them finally acknowledged our existence and said "You'll all have to wait!" in an abrupt manner.
  Charming! The menu is actually pretty good though, with a good selection and reasonable pricing.
  The restaurant occupancy and ambience was good too.
  The goulash came extremely quickly, they obviously keep it ready to go,
  and was actually quite good, with a mix of pork, beef and deer - one of the better ones I've had across Europe,
  although still not as good as my exe's one (just like no Italian restaurant has ever made a bolognese as good as mine,
  they probably wouldn't be willing to spend as much on ingredients).
  The goulash is a stew and came with warm sliced baguette (which would have been better buttered but with the staff
  situation I decided not to bother asking for butter as the food would probably be cold if I did).
  The Wifi didn't work but managed to use another nearby open wifi
- [Hot Horse](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rg1xGNevG82NCmer8) - large bap horse burgers from reconstituted meat, quite good,
  located in [Tivoli Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZWRyGipZuc1y58md8)
- [Hallo Leskovac](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Jr9bHb8sub1pWuiDA) - late night burger and cevapcici fast food

#### Bled

A good day trip destination with a large picturesque lake, historic churches, food stall parade, souvenirs and many
restaurants.
Visited by many foreigners and locals.

It's only around 35 minutes from Ljubljana bombing down the motorway by car, but you can also get there by bus.

- [Lake Bled](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4HNweRwz223Ho1mEA) - the walking trail around the lake is around 6km which will
  take you roughly 1 hour 30 minutes, depending on how often you stop to take pictures as there are many scenic
  viewpoints
- [Bled Castle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4hMngTakzocVPHDm9) on a cliff edge
- [Restavracija Central Bled](https://maps.app.goo.gl/si5qLojW1ea5DJDu8) - good menu and moderate prices.
  The "Central plate", like a mixed grill, was good with a lot of meat: Rumpsteak, pork tenderloin, Carnolian sausage
  with Slovenian cottage cheese rolled dumpling and sautéed potatoes with onions in natural sauce.
  Fast Wifi 453/142 even outside

#### Novo Mesto

For the 7th biggest city in Slovenia, this is one horse town that was dead on a Sunday afternoon.

Ok for a 1 hour stopover, but not much there.

Much of the public street parking is free on Sundays.

- [Bistro Marof](https://maps.app.goo.gl/35ZiLXoQAttw85HL8) - has a good selection of ice creams outside, and good
  outdoor covered seating as well as decently styled interior air conditioned seating.
  There is parking outside too.
  Wifi 7/4 Mbit/s
- [Parkirišče - Novi trg](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TtqcF8UyUJCbiqY19) - public car park with plenty of space, free on
  Sundays

### South Africa

A dangerous high crime country due to high inequality (the Gini coefficient of inequality correlates to crime).

You will need a car in South Africa as its road infrastructure and distancing is similar to the US.

Make sure to lock your doors immediately to reduce risk of carjacking.

#### Johannesburg

Johannesburg, the capital, is where the biz is, where people cite Cape Town by the beach for leisure.

Houses have bars on their windows, barred gates with 2 dogs, and guns for good reason.
Violent home invasions are a common problem -
one of my colleauges in the UK emigrated from South Africa after a home invasion
where they pulled the gate off and invaded a mere 30 minutes after his family had left.
You may only get one close call like that in life.

Stick to the foreigner areas of Sandton and Rosebank. Seriously.

##### Sandton

Has a good mall, restaurants and hotels. The Da Vinci hotel is nice for example.

Nelson Mandela square should be relatively safe thanks to being surrounded by restaurants and mall with security.

##### Rosebank

Also has a mall and good restaurants.

Restaurants on the street outside the mall are patrolled by street security to ensure you make it back to your car.

### Sweden

Ferry from Tallinn in Estonia to Sweden and then another ferry down to Gdanks, Poland, is a way out if your license gets suspended for speeding in Latvia.

Police pulled me over coming off the ferry from Tallinn, Estonia,
and did a very invasive search of my car and all luggage, they opened everything, down to my toiletries and car bonnet.

#### Stockholm

The centre of Stockholm is ok for a day or two, probably not more. It's weirdly broken up into small island-like lands,
and lacks the impressive design and architecture of the central european capitals.
The girls are pretty of course.

The roads are not well designed and it's easy to take a wrong turn,
and parking in a problem in the centre, unlike Warsaw for example.

Do not stay in Kista. Mass immigrated and not one of the safest feeling places.
The Memory Hotel in Kista was cheap for a reason - it was absolutely dead in August like I have never seen before,
no staff most of the time or seeing other guests.

[Restaurang Kryp In](https://restaurangkrypin.se/) is good in the centre.

### Taiwan

#### Taxis in Taiwan

My usual Grab which is popular in SE Asia isn't available in Taiwan, they have Uber and FindTaxi:

- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/tw/en/)
- [FindTaxi](https://apps.apple.com/hk/app/findtaxi/id1023750145?l=en-GB) - never received the SMS verification despite
  several tries so never used this. Ended up using my existing Uber app

#### Taipei

Taipei was too urban for my liking after having toured other parts of SE Asia.

Taipei's structure is surprisingly spread out in an American size layout,
making it take a while to walk around and ages to cross the streets,
with long waits at crossings, and crossings giving 40 to 79 seconds to cross the 6-8 lane roads!

I don't see this region as having enough attractiveness or cost effectiveness to want to visit, which is why I see few
tourists here compared to other countries in SE Asia.

##### Taipei Hotels

Taipei hotels can be more expensive than other destinations in SE Asia
and for some reason their check-ins only seem to be from 5pm instead of 2pm,
even when their checkout is earlier at 11am rather than 12pm.

##### Restaurants in Taipei

This would be a longer list below but I didn't stay in Taipei for more than a few days,
as I prefer other parts of SE Asia, so you'll have to do more Google Maps / Searches yourself to find and try the rest.

- [Busan Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RJhrUyyLzeiC3F5R6) - very popular busy Korean restaurant with top notch
  food at reasonable prices, free red lemon tea and barley tea, as well as free water.
  The beef bibimbap was very good, a really complete nutrition meal with beef, egg, rice, vegetables and even glass
  noodles.
  It's been years since I had a bibimbap this good.
  It even came with a small miso seaweed soup with egg,
  although on my second visit they only gave me a sweetcorn soup with egg.
  92/35 Mbit wifi
- [Nowhere Taipei Mexican Bistro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7R6V7DvF1dtUYwiy6) - Good burrito for £6.50, 82/40 Mbit wifi
- [Nearby Cafe 2](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Uw7WwtsH71dbvxa98) - late night cafe with alcohol as well as food, open until
  midnight with 80/37 Mbit wifi.
  Was half full of people on laptops at 11pm on a Wednesday night.
  Not cheap at £3.50 for a hot milk with honey
- [Raohe Street Night Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HTbYGvSmtKxpyLAB8) - Bustling with food, some tourists and mostly
  local Asians
- [HiHi Coffee / Hi Drink](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uzcEgnYzSLt9kdyp8) - small trendy cafe with good music and fast
  69/49 Mbit wifi that serves alcohol and hot drinks until 1am.
  A bit expensive at 160TWD (£3.70) for a tea though

### Thailand

A fast life strategy place. Lots of tattoos and marijuana coffee shops.

Has pretty much everything - great food, weather, beaches, affordability,
bars & nightclubs, and accommodates every vice one can think of... 🙈

60% of tourists are return visitors and for good reason.

[ThailandRedcat.com](https://www.thailandredcat.com/) - excellent blog on all things Thailand for expats eg. best
beaches, islands, nightlife, clubs etc.

#### ATMs in Thailand - Cash is Needed

You will need cash, big time. Thailand is cheap but lots of places do not take cards.

The ATM machines are thieves and will charge you £5 to withdraw almost any amount of cash,
so you may as well withdraw a larger sum so you get conned by them less often.

If they offer a conversion fee, decline, your bank may change you 3% but ATMs conversion fees are way higher.

#### Mobile Internet in Thailand

I used True5G which has kiosks all over the airport.

You can get 30 days for around £27 or 180 days for around £30.

It works out slightly more expensive than Airalo but the latter one is the best price for such long durations
and even beat my usual Airalo which is better for short term.

#### Taxis in Thailand

If you haven't already set up your card to prepay on the Grab app, you'll need cash.

- [Grab](https://www.grab.com/) - taxi app

#### Food in Thailand

Thai food is great - Pad Thai, Pad Ka Prow
(more commonly called Chilli Holy & Basil in Thailand for some reason even though abroad they use its actual name -
probably because they expect foreigners not to recognize the name),
and Pineapple Rice are some classics to try.

Forget "juice smoothies", they're 10-20% juice, the rest is blended ice and sugar.
If you ask for one without sugar you'll realize it tastes of nothing because it's so diluted.
You're just drinking overpriced sugar water with a little fruit for colour.
If you ask for one which is actually juice, they will ask for double the price. :roll_eyes:

#### Bangkok

[Khao San road](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DQifXctJYKgqZ5b88) is the place to be.

It's buzzing even at midnight on a Sunday or Monday.

Plenty to eat and drink, with many foreigners partying.

Do not stay on Khao San itself or the noise will likely stop you sleeping as it is loud.

[ChinaTown](https://maps.app.goo.gl/miPJtaRt114RaDXJ7) is another good area with many restaurants and street food,
but mostly shuts down by midnight, and I found the hotel to be expensive at £50 per night.

[Khao San road](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DQifXctJYKgqZ5b88) is best for travellers on a budget as it has more affordable
hotels.

##### Food in Bangkok

Mostly eat street food, it's way cheaper than restaurants which charge multiple times the prices.

- [The Fat Cow Yaowarat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KW3bgC8bSPGrXxT88) - gourmet burger restaurant, the Fat Cow burger was
  good, fries were a small portion though. This is expensive for local standards at £8 for a burger and fries, that's
  4x what you can eat street for for

#### Phuket

This is the place to go in Thailand.

The 1980s and 1990s lives on here - live music of the greatest era in known existence.
Take the person you love here.

I am never going back to the West after this.

You will need to fly to Phuket, even within Thailand.

##### Patong Beach

Party central. Most people go here first.

- [Bangla Walking Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qYdBQqnzLsSjwGQ58) - the centre of Patong - full of both bars and
  GoGo bars (Thailand's version of strip clubs where anything goes and you can take the girls home).
  Don't waste your time on the Russian strip clubs, drinks are twice the price of the Thai GoGo bars and you aren't
  taking the girls home unless you want them to demand your whole wallet like you're a simp.
  Quiet during the daytime, have a lazy afternoon drink after the beach,
  starts to pick up more around 6pm onwards until around 3am
- [Banzaan Fresh Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XEHcwEopZ6QTs3qD9) - late afternoon to around 11pm this is the best
  place to eat in Patong, if not all of Phuket. Cheap street food, Thai food, Steaks sliced, Skewers, Sushi, Dumplings,
  Coconut ice cream in a half coconut with toppings like fruits is so good I started getting it every day
- [Malin Plaza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/s3XeKmtPtYHk6Bbb7) - the second best streetfood market, and best open at
  lunchtime, I get lunch here every day
- [Bangla Night Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tKuApZ5UvCG6mtPX8) - the third best street food place in Patong,
  more expensive than the other two
- [Fat Mama](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PwiSNjzcYane8Y73A) - burger restaurant when you need a break from all the amazing
  Thai food
- [Pizzeria Da Moreno Patong](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7E537Gn6SC559EFcA) - good pizza restaurant
- [Kangaroo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KK8xzeYcrongkopLA) - bar with wifi where you can sit facing the road
- [Harem](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bka3VAynHKxt11Cm9) - the best GoGo bar in Patong, likely all of Phuket.
  Take your friend here when you want to corrupt him, or your girlfriend if you want to test her
- [Soi Seadragon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vCQySkXwFTV2VLLT9) - U-shaped road of wall-to-wall GoGo bars (strip clubs)
  with regular bars in the middle
- [Patong Beer Complex](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2ufVagf2uiKRBB9o6) - bunch of outdoor bars, it's not actually closed
  like Google Maps says
- [Thanon Prachanukhro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ykoRiHvdfucDy2ho8) - more bars between here and the beach but less busy,
  more locals
- [Big C](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NhbNtNgV8kHBcbP76) - probably the best Hypermarket to restock your supplies
- [Jungceylon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aVbhAuNJ9jXUEtJo6)) - mall, nothing to write home about, but if you need it,
  or just a reprieve from the sun
- [Bangla Boxing Stadium](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zuFTnTJcHEhZSaKN6) /
  [Patong Boxing Stadium](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FqEcatw3FaJ88ruR9) -
  the first one, Bangla, is more central opposite my favourite Banzan Night Market
  and you can hear the ring announcer from across the street - definitely an experience to have while in Thailand.
  It's full of foreigners because £50 for a ticket is outrageous by local standards and one of the things you'll spend
  the most money on in Thailand

##### Kata Beach

Peaceful beach with a night market with good food, fresh fruits and drinks.

Mostly Russian tourists.

- [Kata Night Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/37YSykPMbrWLFCXi9) - I eat here almost every day for lunch or dinner,
  good food, good prices
- [Sugar Shack](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TuxHc3yQu41ztYc3A) - good food, reasonable prices, a little higher than the
  food market across the road but very reasonable by Thai restaurant standards, busy, friendly accommodating staff
- [The Pizza Company](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kDtrtkG1PSLqpPLq5) - good deep pan pizza when you need a break from Thai
  food, has wifi, open until 3am
- [Pimwilai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B7QoBRSESodkeUBm6) - bar with live music, free pool, comfy couches and wifi,
  open late until 2am
  - there is a bunch of bars next to it too if you prefer but I think this is one of the better ones in terms of
    location and setup

##### Karon Beach

Busier bars than Kata, and similarly Russian tourists.

- [The Garage](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ebXbXatSMqUcFuTH9) - my favourite bar in Karon, very popular, with wifi and
  reasonable drink prices - I love the 1980s legendary American music they sing -
  it's even better than listening to Spotify due to the seriously heavy banging base from the band
- [Sutin Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ypwBzeSXgNK2duK980) - busy bar with live music with wifi
- [Mama Jin](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7XwpFzJKzSFXxEpC8) - good food, prices and service
- [Kiri Burger](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Vn9gWoALFUpqzhd67) - burger bar with reasonable prices and drinks,
  closes early at 10pm for some weird reason, despite having prime seating on the Karon roundabout,
  with last order at 9:30pm
- [Capri Noi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TNe2dAaUXzF9crxF9) - restaurant with steak when you need a change
- [Wat Karon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ghAkJ9oThPRi92X28) - Tue / Friday bi-weekly market of clothes and foods -
  time catching this it's great

#### Pattaya

Beach town that is virtually a brothel. Do not go.

But if you insist...

##### Travel Between Bangkok and Pattaya

Getting to Pattaya from Bangkok will cost you 1500-2000BHT
or you can just taxi to the bus station for 100-20BHT and then take a coach for 131 BHT,
but annoyingly they'll charge you an extra 40BHT for a large suitcase, and 20BHT for a small hand luggage sized suitcase
at boarding time.

##### Restaurants, Bars & Clubs in Pattaya

- [Tree Town Night Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aG5Si6wkohWUEqtp9) - best street food place in Pattaya, good prices,
  my usual lunch stop, it's not only for nights
- [Pattaya Walking Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KwwBUW6tfWEPXvVp8) - the main high street at the end of the beach,
  full of bars and GoGo bars (Thai strip clubs)
- [Muzzik Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rqMCQJDX9ei3t7RK7) - live music bar
- [Russo Touristo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kXPyxdGA681SwEBm7) - Russian bar & restaurant with a dance floor
- [Jalwa Club](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vJnQR86WNMREMXF3A) - best club in Pattaya along with Jannaat
- [Jannaat Club](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L5uWkW7XRRYeHBQH8) - banging popular nightclub - weirdly these two Indian clubs
  are the most banging in Pattaya - I would never have believed it until I saw it as it's not like that in the West
- [Boss Club](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sDiQN6mWpbbXGHNA6) - big nightclub, also Indian, 3rd best
- [Club Panda](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ogcBAHKm9YD9Ls9p9) - Chinese entry only, how racist!!
- [Soi Buakhao](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GDp3R8eC25YDQLkSA) - the main bar strip in Tree Town -
  you will get catcalled by Thai women from the afternoon onwards.
  The worst thing about this area is it's full of rough old English yobs.
  If one's only experience of English people was from here...
  then I'd expect Thais to hate the English
- [Albatross Coffee Roasters](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N5VNi8xLPhnqKbC49) - overpriced coffee shop with wifi
- [Central Pattaya Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mQx2jiWgY63xAUvL6) - mall with wifi
- [Terminal 21](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5QMTom5qbRvA1zpA8) - good mall with a good street food market outside

<!--

- [XS A GoGo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ftw8HELZuDDk6vWGA) - the best GoGo bar in Walking Street IMO, 3 podiums, busy,
  only negative is staff are pushy about ordering more drinks after 30-45 mins because it's busy
- [Baccara A Go Go](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Tr49bG1AN3ZXeQVq9) - the other best GoGo bar in Pattaya,
  more subtle if you're in to the good girl / school girl look
- [Pattaya Soi 6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1xqhb4ctpBaqTm9e6) - the best bar road in Pattaya, women will literally try
  to pull you into bars - best place to go before Soi L K Metro or Walking Street later in the evening
- [Soi L K Metro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/23ecF3E7dQPLU6D29) - L-shaped road of GoGo bars, best time is 9-10pm onwards
- [Soi Pattaya 7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BvehRDwrnrTz812P6)

-->

### Tunisia

This is really a 3rd world country.

From the moment you get off the plane people are trying to scam you left and right,
we were warned about this by several locals - that as soon as they see foreigners they are just thinking about how to
get money off them -
starting with the taxi drivers overcharging my multiples, to people just walking up to you to beg in the streets.

It's the sort of place people go on package holidays to a resort and stay in the managed experience for good reason,
with just trips to the odd historical site like Carthage.

Most people do not speak English -
as it's a former French colony it's more common for their second language to be french, even on menus.

Restaurant staff are not careful with people's allergies as they gave my friend a banana juice based on milk
despite being warned that he is lactose intolerant.

At least 2 restaurants card machines broke, forcing us to pay with cash,
which in hindsight is either bad infrastructure or an excuse to get cash to dodge taxes or something.

Even the pharmacists are not careful,
we went into several different pharmacists to try to buy lactose tablets,
showing the existing container, only for several pharmacists to give sweeteners back!

- Greeting - Salam-Alaikum - meaning Peace Be Upon You
- Thank You - Shkran (shook-ra)

I used the Saily eSim in Tunisia after my Airalo failed to activate.

#### Tunis-Carthage Airport

This airport is incredibly slow for passport control.

When your airline notification tells you to turn up 4 hours in advance, they are telling you for good reason.

Go to departures passport control at least 90 minutes before your flight's departure time
if you don't want to miss it or be stressed out about potentially missing it.

As of 2025 the toilets are very 3rd world, there aren't even toilet seats or toilet paper holders, never mind toilet paper in the
cubicles.
Airplane toilets are luxury by comparison. You are advised to plan to go to the toilet elsewhere.

#### Taxis in Tunisia

The taxi drivers will rip you off worse than most countries.

Not only will they overcharge you,
they have tricks to rack up the meters by pushing a button when you're not looking to jack up the price,
as we were warned by locals.

- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/) - taxi app where you make offers for the trip and wait for drivers to send you their
  offers to accept - very much like the app version of haggling!
  This works in the big cities like Tunis and Sousse, but there was no drivers in the smaller town of Hergla, so we
  had to take louage to Sousse,
  and once in Sousse, taxi drivers were not willing to drive us to Tunis, we again had to find a louage.
  Often the InDrive amount is actually more than the meter in the taxi would have charged, but that's assuming the taxi
  driver hasn't set the wrong rate to overcharge you, so it's safer to just have the price capped and agreed up front

#### Minibuses in Tunisia (Louage)

Take a louage (pronounced loo-ah-zh) minibus instead for like 1-2 dinars instead of 20 - 70 dinars for a taxi,
which is extremely expensive by local standards of earnings.

#### Travelling from Sousse to Tunis

To get to Tunis from Sousse we had to first louage into Sousse, then taxi to
[Louage Station Taffala Sousse](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RAKTuw8RFL4AFYRS7) (using InDrive app above), and then
take a minibus with a red strip for 14 dinars each, plus a few dinars for luggage, which takes around 2 hours.

#### Tunis

Tunis is probably one of the most undeveloped capitals you'll see, really not a tourist destination.

The centre of Tunis doesn't have much going on compared to other capitals around the world.

- [Carthage](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LmAM59xqVSucoHAx8) - the historical site of the rival empire to Rome, of Hannibal
  fame
  - [Archaeological Site of Carthage](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DZEVKv3WaeJtDYoM9) - the main site - tickets cover all
    historical sites for the day
    - [Baths of Antoninus](https://maps.app.goo.gl/y9SERDx2xRESJwRD8)
  - [Carthage Archaeological Site](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5TaEe1LZyFwhnvos6) - secondary archaeological site
    - [Carthage National Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F2K1wMSsCaTXqVgw9)
    - [Saint Louis Cathedral](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9WrLM26UkBB4PYKLA)
  - [Villa Didon Hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/E77SjMQcEQiUFnaK7) - good view, go for a drink on the terrace
- [Sidi Bou Said](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XhQDaG4vkRAdWszS8) - the best tourist area in Tunis, gentrified neighbourhood on the east coast by Carthage,
  with upmarket coffee shops. Recommended by many Tunisian locals
  - [Sidi Bou Said Viewing Point](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1iRGC9LAvow7czTFA) - the best view I saw in Tunisia
- [La Marsa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MFwbqmhR9Np3WLwXA) - beach town area with some restaurants and upmarket villas by
 the sea
  - [The Kitchen Restaurant la Marsa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mMELwdb1S9h7nw3QA) - upmarket meat restaurant with a good
    selection of meats and salads, and good decor including this instagram illuminated wall writing.
    The steaks here are very expensive at 100 dinars per 100g (minimum 300g order), so if you're not in the mood to pay
    the same as upmarket western prices, then the burgers and chicken are very good too.
    The half chicken is served with rice, potatoes, grilled vegetables and salad,
    as well as two dips, one truffle and the other a pepper sauce.
    The pulled BBQ beef burger is very good too, served with fries.
    Overall very good, but it's mere 4.1 Google rating is probably due to the price of the steaks which they will try to
    upsell you on.
    We went a second time but unfortunately they messed up the order, served the wrong thing and refused to change
    it (probably English language barrier).
    The venetian steak was also overdone, although the potato gratin was decent but too small.
    A neighbouring tourist also complained their steak was tough, so perhaps a bit high risk for their steak prices.
    They served us a small complimentary fillet steak medium,
    and that was decent though, so just make sure not to ask for well done as my friend did.
    The kitchen burger we had the second time is also not as good as the BBQ burger from the second visit -
    the marrow they put in it is like eating lumps of fat.
    The basil ginger lemonade also came out too bitter on the second visit too.
    The half chicken remains our favourite dish overall.
    Has wifi
- [Ville Nouvelle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/P9aoY7wAhUuZqEaV9) - Habib Bourguiba Avenue is the city’s main boulevard,
  tree-lined central walkway and a couple grand colonial-era buildings like the art nouveau Municipal Theatre and ornate
  Cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul -
  this is where you will some find coffee shops and eateries but nothing to write home about.
  The highest rated restaurant I would find, Com Art Restaurant, was completely dead in the evening,
  so we went elsewhere
- [Medina](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dmtGMDsMNfw6wVeL8) - the historical centre of Tunis with bazaar,
  but the bazaar is dead and creepy by nightfall and there is rubbish everywhere, we were not impressed, it was very
  ghetto
- [Cité Les Palmeraies](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vEMQm7Xz87iNEX2w5) - residential neighbourhood further out to the east
  with restaurants, a better area than central Tunis, and closer to Carthage
  - [RED Castle L'aouina](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jmMd8quPaFDpYuxRA) - good lebanese restaurant with very good decor, but
    the staff don't speak English and the menu is only in Arabic & French so get your Google Translate app ready.
    The Red Castle mixed platter was decent,
    but I preferred the 4 skewer platter which is slightly better for those focused on lean meat.
    Both come with salad and fries.
    Doesn't have wifi
- [Elbarkoun](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cpskkntooD8JnVTi8) - food was ok, but the hygiene could have been better,
  I had to get the cutlery and plate replaced, and even the replacement wasn't washed properly in the corners of the
  fancy dish.
  The shrimp brik starter was very crispy fried, worth a taste at only 10 dinars.
  The mechouia "salad" is basically grilled green pepper and tomatoes with garlic,
  pepper and lots of olive oil so it's like a dip, not a "salad" as a westerner would understand.
  Many places outside of Tunisia have a similar dish.
  The fish couscous was pretty standard.
  The Oja is basically what westerners call Shakshuka.
  The octopus Kammounia is similar to a Morrocan tagine - a Tunisian tajine is actually an omellette - but the octopus
  was all long tentacles with small heads, it reminded me of Klingon gagh - except it wasn't live and wriggling.
  Regardless, my friend took one bite and left the rest of it.
  Interesting dish if you're a little adventurous.
  Their card machine was broken, had to pay in cash

#### Sousse

You probably don't need more than a day for Sousse, perhaps 2 days if you want to be thorough.

- [Kasbah Citadel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/t6DfLJEsWuFqkxsz5) - the main historical landmark. Unfortunately they don't
  have planning permission so there is a mish-mash of modern buildings of different heights inside it
- [Great Mosque of Sousse](Great Mosque of Sousse) - nice historic architecture
- [Restaurant Café Seles](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V6EzqB2xbRWbyHuw6) - top rated Tunisian food with moderate prices,
  within the Kasbah Citadel.
  The Couscous Royal has a mix of three meats, and is well complimented by a fish tagine.
  The harissa is home made and probably the most standout thing, I ate way too much bread because of their harissa/
  Their card machine was broken, had to pay in cash
- [Fleur d'orient](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3euGNQXPsyyWX9xW9) - decent menu, reasonable prices.
  The chicken skewer platter was good served with chips and salad,
  as well as complimentary bread and dips.
  We actually ate here twice.
  Beware the banana juice is based with milk if you are lactose intolerant,
  the staff did not pick up on this leading to my friend having stomach cramps for days.
  Language barrier of the staff is an issue like usual across Tunisia
  and they are simply not careful with people's allergies
- [Sousse Palace Hotel & Spa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XaeDomMFJ1A3WooY8) has is a nice hotel with a good swimming pool
  and lounge deck area, and was full of Brits. Unfortunately the sky lounges didn't have fresh squeezed orange juice
  and their prices were very high by Tunisian standards

- [Mall of Sousse](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yNnqKj7ynbZEuAQf7)

#### Hammam Sousse

Medium sized coastal town - the Kantaoui area is where people come for nightlife,
but if you've got international standards, you can safely skip this town.

- [Hannibal Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eBqQDsWCy2K1PAQJ6) - amusement park with rides and a few food stalls
  restaurants.
  The fact that this is the height of the nightlife in the area should tell you all you need to know
- [Bar Golf Bräu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/P4K9AQjvFrgUP5LZ9) - lounge requiring reservation, mainly couples who go there
- [Platinum Metalika Sousse](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yXdBF2RCjPYSTx2x5) -
  don't bother, overpriced nightclub at 40 dinars entry per person (€12) - which is outrageous by local standards -
  and it's all guys who go there

#### Hergla

Small quiet one-donkey seaside town, the beach line isn't developed though and the restaurants are closed by 9-10pm.

There is nothing to do here, so you might want to skip this one.

<!-- Dar Yessine Boutique Hôtel I thought was expensive for what it was in this location, despite the rooms being nice,
but then Sousse Palace was significantly more -->

- [Kmayra coffee shop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xZohTKWjjKzY3XiV8) - very nice gentrified coffee shop, open late to
  midnight.
  Very good drinks menu, including a variety of coffees, smoothies, milkshakes, even matcha, all around 9-10 dinars
  each (€3).
  They sell crepes from morning until 4pm, and have a selection of cakes and cookies too.
  A cookie for 8 dinars (€2.50) is expensive by local standards given you can get a proper food grilled chicken wrap
  around the corner for the same price
- [Banque de Tunisie](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ncX86WWf1RYYPiQX6) - ATM worked but had a withdrawal limit of 300 dinars,
  not enough to pay for 2 nights of my overpriced hotel room, with no option to withdraw more via any free form amount,
  necessitating two withdrawals incurring a fee each time

### Turkey

Inflation and rent prices make this not a good value for money destination.

Expensive restaurants and there are only so many times you can eat kebab / mixed grill / dips.

#### Antalya Airport

I had a stop over and missed my connecting flight due to a 2 hour delay by the first flight.

The wifi in Antalya is even worse than in Istanbul. You need to swipe your passport at a kiosk to get a code for a
crappy minimal wifi, medium signal, but crippled bandwidth that web pages don't load. It was unusable on my laptop and
I had to rely on my Expedia app on my phone to eventually load enough for me to book a flight out of there.

This was the worst wifi experience I ever remember, even worse than Istanbul and Tbilisi.

The wifi was so terrible that after an hour of struggling to use it I ended up paying €6 for the
_"High Speed Internet"_, which was also unusable and kept cutting out.

#### Istanbul

Istanbul is one big tourist trap.

I am shocked how expensive Istanbul is, triply so arriving from Morocco.

Everybody seems to be out to overcharge you or cheat you as you will see in both the taxis and restaurants sections
below:

##### Taxis in Istanbul

Taxi drivers are terrible for trying to scam tourists in Istanbul.

One taxi driver quoted me _"20 Euros"_ (not even their local currency) to go literally 1 mile down the road!

Even an official black taxi in London wouldn't charge you that much.

I asked 2 taxi drivers
to take me from Gayrettepe to Sultanahmet and they flat out refused in Turkish without speaking English.

I tried the [BiTaksi](https://www.bitaksi.com/en) app and it failed to find drivers for me several times,
even with tips pre-added.
I ended up walking the last mile to my accommodation.

I managed to get a taxi to the airport using [BiTaksi](https://www.bitaksi.com/en) when leaving
but the taxi driver charged me 1080 lira (£21) on the BiTaxi app and then another 1700 lira (£33) on card in person at
the end of the ride, and just after I tapped my card to pay, the app then also charged me (probably because he ended the
journey on his app only after this), thereby not only overcharging me but also cheating me by charging me twice.
I reached out to BiTaksi several times via in app chats and emails to request a refund for at least one of the double
charges but they never responded.

This pretty much sums up the experience in Turkey.

##### Restaurants in Istanbul

Restaurants will often cost £30 per head without alcohol for mediocre food that would be cheaper even in the UK.

£6 for an orange juice when it was £1.50-£2 in Morocco the week earlier...
£2-4 for a water. Meanwhile in the supermarkets a fresh squeezed juice in a bottle is £1.50 or a 500ml water bottle for 10-20p.

The locals says it is because of the rent prices and that Antalya is even more expensive.

It hardly even matters which restaurant you go to, it's like they're all roughly price fixing rather than competing.

Google Maps reviews can't be trusted - almost everywhere seems to have 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, or 5.0 ratings for places that
would be 4.1 - 4.3 in the rest of the world.

You follow to a _"recommended"_ place and find it even more overpriced than the others.
Either reviews are not factoring in price or there is a lot of fake review inflation in Istanbul.

The airport is, expectedly even worse.
£17 for a bolognese that would be £5-8 anywhere else, £20 for a burger etc.
The burgers look lowed grade compared to Gourmet Burger Kitchen back home.

I can't honestly recommend many places in Istanbul as I was not impressed, but here are a couple:

- [Hafiz Mustafa 1864](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Hafiz+Mustafa/@41.0088626,28.9685038,15.55z?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgxMC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) -
  famous dessert shop chain, highly rated for good reason.
  A few of them are 24 hours with people enjoying socializing there even well past midnight
- [Coffee No.4](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dATVSgQKREc3RzGC7) - the ground pistacchio speciality is amazing, and brewed in
  a traditional hot sand - a little pricey but I loved it

<!-- -->

- [Hagia Sophia Grand Mosque](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RzSr4B9S1WodNvTP6)
- [Topkapi Palace Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mmV1dPjXYsAFZSGBA)
- [Galata Tower](https://maps.app.goo.gl/w3bqNYg6CRigXsJR8)

Wasn't impressed:

- [Bistro corner cafe restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NGeUjbeJJe7gqSEYA)
- [Paradise seafood kebap restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9sV4cVQp55vjbyEZ6)
- [Cozy Garden Fish And Meat Restaurant](Cozy Garden Fish And Meat Restaurant)

- [The First Ottoman Lounge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F79T1ZVfapehFsqf7)

### UAE

The United Arab Emirates is one of the most civilized and safe societies I have ever seen.

It is one of my favourite countries in the world, but is best suited to very successful people due to the high cost of
living caused by the influx of millionaires fleeing high tax social democracies.

They have zero tolerance for criminals or welfares spongers, which is why it is so safe and they don't tax half your
income.

UAE would literally deport half of the UK, who are net drains to the state, which is why it's such a nicer place.

#### Driving in UAE

Do not use Google Maps in Dubai, it is awful.

It will give you wrong directions or verbal instructions that do not match the map direction,
leading you to taking many wrong turns which can cost you half an hour in journey time as you try to navigate around
large blocks of motorways.

Use Waze instead.

#### Abu Dhabi

The capital of the UAE.

More relaxed, than Dubai.

##### Restaurants in Abu Dhabi

- Paradiso - I dropped nearly £100 just for my half, but I did get the steak... good quality, the price of drinks adds up

#### Dubai

Dubai is more of a city-state than a city as Europeans would understand it.

It would be extremely difficult to walk due to the large distances and high heat.

*"I don't walk anywhere in Dubai"* one of my Brit guys there told me. I saw why after I arrived. Even a 15 minute walk
to lunch will leave you a sweaty mess by the time you get there.
People drive with air conditioning and dive into malls, offices and restaurants with air conditioning.

I used Virgin Mobile on a prepaid contract for around £200 for the year which was the cheapest deal I could find.

##### Metro in Dubai

Good for the areas it covers.

Very cheap, typically 3 or 5 dirhams per for a single one-way journey using a prepaid Nol card
depending on if you're going 1 or 2 zones.
This works out to a mere 65p or £1.10!!

Buy a Nol card immediately for 25 dirhams which has 19 dirhams of credit already pre-loaded on it.

##### Taxis in Dubai

You will need a car or taxi to really get around.

[Careem](https://www.careem.com/) is the everything app, including Taxis.

It does everything from Uber-style taxis, to food delivery, to rental bicycles.

##### Parking in Dubai

Parking is easy in most of the malls but really difficult near the Dubai World Trade Center.

The [Al Saada parking](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hGDTeF9eKRzmPYV69) is a large free open air car park that is a gem known
only to the local workers.
Occasionally it is blocked off for DWTC events, but there is another smaller open air car park around the block
[here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jMzPUWreB5ypQ1gw9).
I avoid using the Al Mustaqbal car park as it is expensive at 10 AED per hour.

##### Weather in Dubai

The weather is so hot even by May some people use sun umbrellas - so hot that it broke my car phone holder.
Rich people usually leave Dubai and go to Europe for the summer.
Copying them was how a lot of the European countries on this list were covered!

##### Attractions in Dubai

Dubai has a good mix of beaches and malls.
It is built in the US style where a mall is not just a shopping venue but a destination with lots of restaurants & cafes
as well as activities.

- [Dubai Marina](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4NuAPJvdNj69mmqy5) - long walk with boats and restaurants -
  an excellent place to rent an e-scooter via Lime or bike via Careem since it's a 7km oval
- [JBR Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pR6TbPo8jbWeu7sM6) - popular tourist beach with the usual mix of restaurants
  and cafes
- [Downtown / Dubai Mall / Burj Khalifa area](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kdrUMenKN1bQd2tP8) - not just a mall,
  everything is here, countless restaurants and coffee shops (relatively expensive) and
  even indoor skating and aquarium with sharks and rays, the water fountains and surrounding area
- [Dubai Marina Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pAcde92GnfexCE2N8) - smaller mall on the Marina but high quality,
  everything from Wagamama to Waitrose to designer shops and good restaurants
- [Dubai Hill Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uwsPNDjDJjBystDi9) - large suburban mall with all the usual shops and
  restaurants
- [Mall of the Emirates](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qo3gmeqpzxHU8goj9) - popular mall with even indoor skiing,
  in the Al Barsha area which is mostly asian rather than western mix international like Dubai Mall or Dubai Marina Mall
- [Kite Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9s53Wg9S7vV7Rd8w5) - long popular beach with cafes for cool drinks, e-scooters,
  and hipster restaurants at the north end
- [Dubai Festival City Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oEg1ZAUTMaPLGAULA) - another very good large mall near Dubai Creek
- [City Centre Mirdif Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XR684KR9Zw7teHKL9) - another very good and large mall near Dubai Creek
- [Deira City Center Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dnovu1E47J96KpNp9) - another good mall with an Acai Spot,
  restaurants, and all the usual brands
- [City Walk](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Suov6sK76gn9aXP96) - cafes and restaurants in an outdoor retail complex with a
  tree-lined esplanade and central fountain
- [Global Village](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295424-d2038312-Reviews-Global_Village-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html) -
  only open October to April

##### Restaurants in Dubai

Often restaurants outside of the malls are better in terms of prices.

- [Doors in Dubai Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9s53Wg9S7vV7Rd8w5) - fancy upmarket restaurant overlooking the
  Burj Khalifa water fountains. Go for a special occasion. You will pay £10 per juice
- [Tashas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rHzL2Sbo8uxodN3E9) - high quality restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating on the
  Dubai Marina
- [Moshi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xLCidAUmxFmP1XyT6) - small place with great asian food, Thai Tom Yum soup and Sushi,
  just outside the Mall of the Emirates
- [Acai Spot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ogJxLHpscsk4fVTBA) - chain Acai cafe throughout Dubai, pricey but good.
  I usually get the tropical or make your own
- [Angel Cakes Dubai Hills Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CJVaPFEXE9Xcs3CY8) - gentrified cafe serving food, cakes and
  drinks.
  Small chain, also available at Dubai Mall and Bluewaters (next to JBR)
- [Habib Beirut](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TdwLSXHzvYqwhKLe8) - good lebanese on the Marina, a short walk from
  Dubai Marina Mall
- [Alyasamin Aldimashqi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DtF6nwJy9mGDeVAh9) - good Syrian restaurant opposite Deira City Center Mall
- [Greenland](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NGURNp991VaCpFNR8) - local indian chain, 24x7, affordable,
  big selection of fresh juices
  There are outlets in various areas of Dubai
- [JusGrill](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9ia8SB2jGbaGxBU69) - local cheap eats in Al Rigga serving Indian, Chinese &
  Filipino food
  The Pancit Bihon (Filipino equivalent of singapore noodles) is good,
  as is the spicy Prawn Schezwan Fried Rice which contains lots of fresh green chillis.
  There is a large selection of fresh juices,
  but the Coconut Shake and Mango Passion Special are particularly good (I was getting one of these two daily)
- [Umami](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LcKVp4C6sZ72t1Nv6) - Japanese chain in the mall food courts, cheap and cheerful for
  a bento box, my pick if you're caught in a mall food caught with too much fast food
- [Favoreat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pJXGbtYvb6EPHU6A9) - outside City Center Deira Mall, it has an Ethiopian menu that
  is good with that special sour pancake thing they do with a variety of foods on it
- [Al Rigga Night Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dVxrrWQwxGW1KoNQ7) - full of cheap eats, and the market opposite,
  bustling at midnight, open until 2am

##### Visas for Dubai

You are required to get a medical blood screening, chest x-ray, biometrics like fingerprinting to get a visa here.

Once you have residence you are no longer allowed to use your UK driver's license
and will get a shock as your car rental company refuses to release the car to you.

You will then need to Careem around the city to get your Emirates ID and then your Drivers License which will require
local bank or cash payment.

##### Banking in Dubai

- [Mashreq](https://www.mashreq.com/) is the easiest to use, app-only like Starling or Monzo
  - but I lost 5% on a GBP-to-GBP transfer from ADCB to Mashreq... Bitcoin transaction fees are
    [usually much lower](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee).
- [ADCB](https://www.adcb.com/en/personal/) is the next best, but the premium account is a big hassle and has a
  substantial minimum balance requirement of 500,000 AED that many people will not be able to meet
  - See the 5% loss above sending GBP-to-GBP from ADCB to Mashreq (estimate 1.68% on ADCB's side even using a premium account)
  - I calculated a GBP to AED transfer within ADCB cost 1.66% hidden in a worse conversion rate. This is outrageous if
    you were to transfer or convert large amounts of money such as your life savings.
- [Emirates NBD](https://www.emiratesnbd.com/en) has a bad reputation among my peers for being a lot of hassle
  - they were a hassle to open, wanting salary certificate
  - even closing the account is difficult apparently according to my colleague at the time (too much questioning)
- [HSBC](https://www.hsbc.ae/) was a similar hassle to NBD above wanting salary certificate addressed specifically to them
  - they actually rejected my employer's salary certificate because it wasn't addressed specifically to their bank
  - much more hassle, not like HSBC back in the UK, most UK banks just open accounts easily
  - even already having an HSBC UK account didn't help me

### Ukraine

Ukraine is not really a tourist destination, even outside of the war,
as it lacks attractions, centralization, good quality restaurants & diversity of cuisine,
or even much in the way of tourist accommodation compared to other European countries.

There are some decent restaurants, as with everywhere, if you look a bit harder and are willing to spend.

Many of the restaurants use the same `choiceqr.com` and `expz.menu` websites for their menus which often fails to translate
substantial parts of the menu when selecting English, or crash with a server side application error when trying to
expand the menu ingredients of a dish.
This happens even to some of my favourite restaurants in Kyiv / Lviv / Odessa.

Even worse, many places lack English entirely and don't even have English menus,
including even the massive Lviv Croissants chain on the main Khreschatyk St in Kyiv.

The weather in Odessa was so bad by the end of September that I cancelled my return to Ukraine and just took the losses
on my bookings.
Hours of heavy downpour and the streets were flooded there was no way to cross roads
without going ankle deep and soaking your shoes and lower trousers.
I was soaked, cold and dripping top to bottom even with an umbrella.
It's rare to see such aggressive rains in other parts of the world, and their lack of adqueate

There are hundreds of destinations in Europe that would be ahead of Ukraine to visit as a tourist.

I've used Airalo and Nomad mobile e-sims in Ukraine.

#### Taxis in Ukraine

- [Bolt](https://bolt.eu/en-ua/) - more drivers than OnTaxi
- [OnTaxi](https://ontaxi.com.ua/en) - no drivers picked up in Kyiv
- [Uklon](https://uklon.com.ua/en/) - didn't receive the verification SMS so couldn't use it

#### Buses in Ukraine

Bus have credit card touch devices.

In Kiev it was easier, just touch card which charged it 8uah (£0.14).

In Lviv I had to select a couple of touch screen options before touching the card. You can change the menu to English.

#### Coaches in Ukraine

Coaches go between Kyiv and Odessa regularly, you can book them via the Omio website:

<https://www.omio.com/>

The LikeBus has wifi (password is just 12345678)
so you can ride in style and watch your favourite show as it is a 6 hour journey.

#### Trains in Ukraine

Make sure to book your rail tickets in advance before travelling between cities as they sell out.

Use the official Ukrainian government railways bookings website:

<https://booking.uz.gov.ua/>

The trains are old Soviet night trains which means cabins of 4 small bunks so when you see upper and lower on the
booking website, choose lower, it is more convenient than having to climb up to the upper bunk as the lower bunk is
basically the couch & bed whereas the upper bunk is not so comfortable without being able to rest your legs on the
ground.

The small table is also usable for the lower bunks.

#### Kyiv

Kyiv is the newer spelling derived from Ukrainian, instead of Kiev, the old spelling derived from Russian.

My favourite areas are Zoloti Vorota and Podil as that's where the better restaurants are.

<!--
Dream Hostel Kyiv is cheap and in Podil, so a bit of a walk to the centre, but the communal toilets and showers
are nowhere nice as the one in Lviv.

GlobeRunner Rooms is twice the price but so much nicer inside that I can't go back to Dream Hostel now.
-->

- [Musafir](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Musafir) - middle eastern restaurant chain of 4 (at time of writing) with
  a large menu at reasonable prices.
  It has the usual selection of starters like cacik, hummous with optional chicken or beef, as well as good soups, and
  grilled meat mains.
  Has wifi
- [Holy Burger](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GUMVmUnqJSkcJ1pq6) - large upmarket burger restaurant with great seating,
  indoors and outdoors, a good selection of burgers and other main dishes, as well as a good selection of drinks.
  The holy burger is good, albeit not as big as I thought it might be, a mid-sized burger.
  The fries are very good, crispy and fluffy, I just wish there were more of them.
  Wifi 74/91 Mbit/s
- [Fandom coffee bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8f2FAdrSCYg6zUzFA) - upmarket (expensive) cafe restaurant with plush
  interior, good menu, fresh juices and a good selection of desserts.
  The sliced chicken fillet with truffle mashed potato, brocoli and paprika sauce was good,
  although it took a while to come, and the fresh apple juice was decent too, served in a heavy whisky glass.
  Has wifi
- [Gastro bar Пахне смаженим](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qAWQg6tcDWqRwtHL7) - good quality burger restaurant, highly rated
  with stacked burgers and decent fries.
  The venue itself is fairly small and on the big ring road, so the venue itself loses out to the nicer social spot
  Holy Burger.
  The burger with the cherry sauce came with a white cheese similar to feta but less salty.
  They give you those black gloves to eat the burger with that seems to be popular here with the gentrified burger
  restaurants. The extra honey-mustagard dip for the fries was decent too.
  Has wifi
- [True Burger Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XfsD4suQs3cD4FPV8) -
  good gourmet burger menu with good range of burgers and even vegetarian burgers.
  It also has all day breakfasts and fresh orange and grapefruit juices.
  It is expensive by local standards, internationally tourist priced, so it was dead on a Tuesday evening
  while the McDonalds a few few feet along the street was packed.
  The burger with bacon and mango sauce was very good at 438uah (€9),
  and came stacked, with fries and you can choose which sauce you want, I chose bbq sauce which was exactly as I wanted.
  The fresh orange juice was decent and a reasonable size for 170uah (€3.50).
  Overall I spent €15 on a burger with fries and a drink.
  Wifi is open (TrueBurgerBar) 81/80 Mbit/s
- [This is Пивбар на Подолі / This is PivBar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ypb8zh3P8TQXUakq8) - good menu, open a bit later
  than other places until 11pm, but by 10pm only burgers and salads were available to order.
  The "big beef" burger was a double stacked burger, very good in both texture, flavour and quality -
  it had two patties in between a triple bun, with two types of cheddar and bacon jam.
  This was surprisingly good but it didn't come with fries,
  and by the time it was delivered and I realized to order fries separately at 22:15, they had closed the kitchen.
  The waiter wsa not that good in English to inform me of this and ask if I wanted to order a side.
  At 450uah (€9.30), this is also relatively very expensive for Ukraine.
  The fresh squeezed orange juice (195uah / €4) was a reasonable size though, appearing bigger than 250ml.
  Wifi 17/19 Mbit/s
- [Lviv Croissants](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Lviv+Croissants/) - widespread chain, cheap and good quality
  large croissants with beef, chicken or other fillings.
  The name implies it's from Lviv but it's also all over Kiev
- [Puzata Hata](https://puzatahata.ua/) - Ukrainian canteen, cheap and cheerful local food. Try the borsche red soup
  with meat. The dumplings were ok but not that great quality of meat inside
- [Urban Grill Meat & Cider](https://maps.app.goo.gl/q9AUwGVoRzrqanq9A) - the blackberry burger was decent here, and the
  sweet potato fries came with a really nice sweet chilli dip that wasn't like the usual types.
  I didn't go with the regular fries as they were covered in cheese sauce.
  Burger, chips and an orange juice came to €15.
  Has wifi
- [Chacha - Hruzynsʹkyy Restoran](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ooPf4bhwQ95wPjYNA) - decent quality Georgian with the usual
  dishes like traditional Karcho soup and Khinkali dumplings, although not that cheap (I dropped €16).
  The Karcho soup was decent but small.
  The Khinkali assorted 5 dumplings themselves came in a giant Khinkali, that is a lot of pastry.
  Do not order fresh juices here, they are tiny 200ml in an extremely thin glass, are not on the digital menu and cost
  250uah (over €5!) - they are not worth it
- [Novella](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZagSm2ZWEZRhkvDo7) - upmarket (expensive) restaurant, same menu as Biblioteka in
  Lviv, see review there
- [Bowl House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yR5mNwQdWwmzps2F6) - they were out of "Tom Yam"
    soup so tried the Bowl-salad Brize (409uah / €8.50) with prawns and tuna.
    This isn't a lot of food, it's ok for a girl on a diet, but not for a bro trying to maintain his muscle.
    The clientele on a Saturday afternoon was was mostly women having a drink in their Sex & The City groups.
    The fresh orange juice was tiny no more than 200ml which wasn't worth it for 145uah (€3).
    Wifi 5/5 Mbit/s
- [Druzi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/U95FR6NX8UTiSmGs9) - different menu to the one in Lviv. The one in Lviv is better but
  unfortunately this one still has the tourist prices.
  The cheesecakes with vanilla cream and blueberries was ok but nothing to write home about
- [Khreschatyk St](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VADCJzDdb86zAchu8) - the main high street in central Kyiv
  - [TSUM](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Hp4raovXhVS33m488) - upmarket department store with the usual brands and a couple
    restaurants / cafes on the top floor

- [DOM #10](https://maps.app.goo.gl/T3spm6qxXb9RGAxf9) - upmarket very expensive restaurant with exquisite menu - an
  experience place.
  You're looking at €30 per main here, which for Ukraine is crazy, and they have a truffle & black truffle menu of
  dishes
- [Lofter Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ksa1De5caHHUV2vu7) - steaks
- [Chicot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KQRumb2AHqLB6nqv8) - highly rated but no online menu
- [Sanatrelo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eKL6UYFJmfh9QS2n9) - Georgian
- [Chichiko](https://maps.app.goo.gl/suxeACdBw24tWzTU8) - Georgian
- [Chachapuri](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iMFtAVwabVsvxfkW6) - Georgian

#### Lviv

A small city on the Western edge of Ukraine, far from the war.
Much more peaceful than Kyiv's frequent air raids but you'll run out of things to do and eat after a few days.

<!--

Dream Hostel Lviv was both good and cheap.

- [Split Club](https://maps.app.goo.gl/375a7uwbJ4tG5fVGA) - expensive restaurant with an excellent strip club above it,
  even better than Club Number 1 in Warsaw, thanks to a local Brit expat Mike for taking us there

-->

- [Diana Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Di89nWanMmpvnTct8) - excellent location and very reasonably priced breakfasts -
  the roast beef breakfast with two eggs is good here and very affordable for 215 UAH (€4.50).
  They don't have fresh squeezed juices unfortunately.
  Wifi is open with no password (Fest Client) 2.5/2 Mbit/s
- [Friends / Druzi Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XTb7MacgpbF1xfDq8) - gentrified cafe with good food menu, tables,
  plugs, couches, and large garden terrace, Breakfast until 2pm, sweet breakfasts for
  230-285 UAH (€6).
  The Borscht with torn veal for 175 + 65uah (€5) was surprisingly good, and comes with strong rye bread and sour cream
  which enhance and contrasts flavours very well.
  It is not a "bacon sandwich" as the menu describes as a westerner would understand that but more like 3 pieces of
  triple stacked rye bread with a thin layer of bacon fat in between them - it works very, very well.
  TODO: try the hashbrown with roast beef and horseradish cream sauce for 305uah for breakfast or later in the day
  try the beef stew with mash for 325 (€7).
  They also have fresh orange / grapefruit juices in both 200ml for 145 (€3) or double size not on the menu for 400ml
  sizes (€6).
  Wifi 70/79 Mbit/s
- [Svit Kavy (Rynok Sq.)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/y6Vy9JTTJh7bst4K8) - chain of two with slightly different menus -
  fresh juices, eggs breakfasts, good selection of teas as well as coffees, pancakes, sandwiches.
  The veal half sandwich on rye bread is only available at this one,
  for only 200uah it's a good deal and despite being under the "snacks" section on the menu it's a fairly substantial
  smaller meal.
  Wifi is open without a password, Svit Kavy network, but slow 0.9/0.4 Mbit/s
- [Lviv Croissants](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Lviv+Croissants/) - widespread chain, cheap and good quality
  large croissants with beef, chicken or other fillings. Also found in Kiev
- [Holy Moly](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oV6hSoVXvk3NcWSh9) - trendy hipster bar restaurant with good selection of burgers
  but at tourist prices eg 400uah (€8+), which is expensive by local standards.
  The "Moly Never Cry" burger was very good with crispy onion rings, bacon and all the usual salad.
  They also have fresh squeezed orange / grapefruit / lemon juice for 140 uah (€3).
  Wifi 24/25 Mbit/s
- [Biblioteka](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bnf72TzEnUN5Fxp4A) - upmarket (expensive) restaurant with lovely interior and
  very good food but tourist prices. I blew €25 on lunch here, which for Ukraine is quite expensive.
  The guacamole starter with lime, focaccia and smoked paprika was tasty but a bit small for my liking.
  The beef soup was very good but then it should be for 375uah (nearly €8) - it contains bavette (a specific cut of
  beef) slices, veal broth, garlic, ginger, chilli pepper, cherry tomatoes, pickled red onion and linguine cooked just
  right, al dente.
  The pork steak with mash was amazing, a fine dining experience with burgundy sauce, a moat of fine mash and
  caramelized onions on top of the pork steak.
  Unfortunately it's priced at 399uah plus 100uah per 100g,
  so you won't know exactly how much it costs until you get your bill, but roughly 550-600uah.
  The menu is also entirely only (QR codes on the tables), and bill can be paid online the same way, but the online menu
  is not properly translated with many parts stuck in Ukrainian, not English,
  and even the picture vs description was clearly wrong on one item which appears as a lamb shank but described as a
  pasta dish.
  Wifi is fast and open with no password (Biblioteka Guest) 88/91 Mbit/s
- [Medivnya 1979 - Restoran Ukrayinsʹkoyi Kukhni](https://maps.app.goo.gl/R3o4Jpqfxe9MFH4p6) - good quality restaurant
  with good menu and good seating - has a small outdoor row of tables to people watch the main street, good interior
  seating and a large rear terrace.
  The beef tenderloin with carrot & citrus puree was very good in both quality and flavour, not a large portion, but
  fine dining, which leaves space for dessert!
  The chocolate walnut cake with cherry compote and vanilla ice cream was so good I'd go back for that alone.
  The kitchen closes at 22:30.
  Wifi 4/1 Mbit/s even in the rear terrace.
- [Cukor RED](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XmaNV2fQmJhHth7eA) - the summer breakfast is a bit pricy at 390 UAH
  (€8) but is very good and well rounded with 2 poached eggs with parmesan, salmon, rye bread, avocado, labneh,
  edamame, strawberries and blueberries.
  They do have fresh squeezed orange juice, and table water, both served with solid glasses.
  They also have a full english breakfast, eggs royale (eggs benedict with salmon) and a version with seared salmon.
  The wifi connected but didn't work for me

TODO:

- [Atlas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Eq9P8ofrSeePXk8S8)
- [Black Honey](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2dLFumDiKThPLBbC8) - 4.7

#### Odessa

<!--

Hostels in Odessa are substantially cheaper than in Kyiv.

The Friday hostel is cheap at €5 per night but they lock the door at 11pm
and the reception guy is grumpy, doesn't want to make any allowance to get back later
and the Friday wifi doesn't work in the lobby and the grumpy guy refuses to give the password for the other network
Friday Management that works in the lobby.

-->

- [Restaurant 52](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nQnhBnrLiHbikDk47) - upmarket hotel restaurant with lovely interior and a bar,
  but prices seem surprisingly reasonable for a "hotel restaurant", as such as usually overpriced.
  Closes at 9pm though.
  The best Ukrainian borscht soup I've had in Ukraine, medium sized, good flavour,
  served with sour cream and two small warm buns.
  The chicken kebab was as bland as one would expect, try something else next time, although the pickled onions on the
  side were good.
  I had a side of mash with it which while soft was too bland even for mash (my mash is far superior).
  The chocolate cherry cake was well balanced though, not too sweet.
  Wifi 48/34 Mbit/s
- [Atelier. Food & Crafts](https://maps.app.goo.gl/D3we7E7fnWNrdTE3A) - good quality food and reasonable prices,
  opposite Books Market.
  I wanted to try the veal cheeks but they'd run out so I had the half chicken with roasted pepper sauce,
  naan bread and iceberg lettuce and pickled red onion side salad, which was all better than expected.
  The toasted sourdough bread with sun-dried tomato pesto was also better than expected as starter.
  Has wifi
- [TREF cinema cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gfSzVHk1SyfEujKy8) - spacious upmarket interior with nice bar area and huge
  tv and two levels of indoor seating around a large internal dome balcony, as well as outdoor seating in the
  Victory Arboretum park. The menu is decent and reasonably priced.
  The borscht veal soup is smaller than other places but tasted good.
  The "blue anchan" latte is a novelty here - a blue tea from flower buds of the herbaceous Liana Clitoria Ternatea.
  The coconut-Parmesan is a cheese dessert with no added sugar on a thin chocolate biscuit base so not very sweet and
  came in a blue rather than red dusting as pictured.
  Has wifi
- [True](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kcZq3CDoR3DRC4fQ9) - decent food but they often close much earlier than Google Maps
  says - 10pm officially but twice I've been turned away at 8:55pm and then 8:20pm on Thursday and Friday nights due to
  lack of customers they decided to close at 9pm and even half an hour before refused to serve food, only drinks -
  perhaps because it is near the park and so gets more day time trade.
  The bean borscht soup is quite substantial and full of vegetables.
  The cossack style pork steak covered in tomato sauce was pretty decent and lean, with pickled red onions on the side.
  Has wifi
- [Mr. Chef](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GDWCS2meSP2zumz77) - huge chicken / veal toasted wraps for 250uah (€5), this could
  easily feed 2 people, I left 1/3 of it.
  This is a good budget choice.
  Has wifi

<!-- -->

- [Books Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AjzVkgrCh9iggpbJ6) - coffee shops and bars in a park strip
- [Gagarinn Plaza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kw7RooiVkpLfoD8S8) - probably the best mall they have in Odessa, but that's
  not saying much - there is a sushi restaurant on the 3rd floor that I can't find on Google Maps which unfortunately
  puts cream cheese in everything, but if you get just the salmon and tuna maki, it is decent
- [Arcadia City](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hQ9UgT3UUbMXavaW7) - popular outdoor plaza with shops, restaurants & clubs, as
  well plus an aquatic park & ice-skating rink, between Arcadia Beach and Garaginn Plaza mall
- [Level Karaoke Club](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oLKz9LrmNz9mkjZi8) - mostly locals, asks for reservation despite being
  half empty, fussy at entrance, and no gym bro vests. Otherwise reasonably ok

Not Recommended:

- ["Mick O'Neills" Gastro Pub](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Urgh32xEwvTfFMdo8) - expensive mediocre food, don't eat here.
  Popular socializing place with a pool table, this might be ok for a late night drink (up to 11pm!) but the food was
  disappointing, especially for €10 per dish (at least the other tourist places charging international prices have
  higher quality).
  The Jack Daniel's burger had no Jack Daniel's taste, you will mistake it for a regular bland burger.
  Their excuse is they've fried a tiny amount of onions in it but even if you just eat those little pieces by themselves
  you can't taste the Jack Daniel's.
  Wetherspoon's Jack Daniel's burger in the UK at least has Jack Daniel's sauce and is a completely different experience.
  The fresh apple juice was ok, served in a heavy whisky glass, but the orange and other juices are overpriced.
  I ate here was because most other places were closed by 9-10pm, so you can keep it as one of the few later places, but
  you might want to save your money and just get a McDonalds or KFC if you want mediocre late night food.
  Has wifi

- Hertfordshire:
  - [St Albans](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jh4eURxb9r1kiiW78) and the Roman [Verulamium Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2hMD9RxjvHJaLVQ8A)

- North Yorkshire:

    historic architecture dating back to Roman times, lots of nice coffee shops
- Gloucestershire:
  - [Cotswolds](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ltn9WceBcb2xESS79)

<!-- - ~~[Reading](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sPzxGJPXa59LGvHM6)~~ -->

Most of the areas apart from Central London are small enough you can cover their key central parts in 1-2 days each.

#### Best Areas in London

Central London you could easily spend over 2 weeks to just see the highlights, eg.
a day at each of these:

1. Natural History Museum (excellent)
1. Kensington & Kensington Palace Gardens (excellent multi-area kids playground) & the large Hyde Park (these are joined)
1. Big Ben, Houses of Parliament, London Eye, Sea Life aquarium, South Bank restaurants & seasonal street food stalls
1. Buckingham Palace & St James Park, Belgravia, Chelsea
1. Oxford Street and Regent Street for shopping
1. Picadilly, China Town, Soho restaurants and bars
1. The British Museum
1. Knightsbridge - Harrods famous department store has nearly everything, even posh food and souvenir teas
1. Marylebone & Regents Park
1. Notting Hill market, street food, clothing and restaurants (market runs on Saturdays only)
1. Richmond & Richmond Park (excellent)
1. Hampton Court Palace gardens & Bushy Park (excellent)
1. Tower Bridge & Borough Market
1. Greenwich, the Cutty Sark, Royal Observatory, Mudchute Farm
1. Camden Town, Kings Cross, Angel, Islington
1. Westfields mall at Shepherds Bush (it's better than the one at Stratford)
1. Shoreditch, Baribican, Spitalfields Market, Brick Lane for authentic Indian cuisine on a night out

You will not be able to hit all the good areas with good restaurants in 2 weeks actually because London has so many,
there are other areas like the City financial district around Bank of England through to Canary Wharf,
as well as other zone 2-5 areas like Earl's Court, Fulham, Putney, Barnes, Hammersmith, Wimbledon, Twickenham,
Teddington, Ealing Broadway, South Woodford, Wanstead, Bromley, Beckenham, Chessington theme park etc.

#### Best Restaurants in London

London is easily the restaurant capital of the world,
not even California can boast the variety and quality of London restaurants, nor can any other city on this list.

I prioritize food quality and price,
so we'll start with more independent and affordable places, then move to more fancy further down.

There are simply far too many great restaurants in London to list them all, especially from 2 decades of memories,
and nobody can agree on a definitive top list, but here is a good start:

- [Taro (Soho)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xbh6RB5YUFj6njTi9) - foodie place for Japanese noodles and sushi. The bento
  boxes here were my favourite
- [Yalla Yalla](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WK3RLN6t9pCkUGkN6) - a favourite Lebanese of mine in Soho.
  The sujuk sausages in lemon zesty sauce were my favourite of any place,
  and I've forever been disappointed in Turkish restaurants sujuk by comparison.
  Fattoush salad is a must here (or any lebanese / syrian or similar restaurant!).
  The houmous with lamb is a worthy upgrade too and stuffed vine leaves are always good.
  I liked the homemade lemonades as they were exotic mixes (Pomegranate & Orange Blossom, Watermelon & Rose, or Apple, Mint & Ginger).
  The Mouhalabia dessert was my favourite here.
  There is also a sister restaurant [Yalla Beirut](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Gn5NZE72UkdQv1Za7) at Tower Hill
- [Black Bear Burger](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mu94ZHu3mVo3mbM49) - the black bear and brisket burger were both good, as
  were the fries
- [Hiba Street Food](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7wwTZAgRghbvPNv27) - good Lebanese food
- [Wagamama](https://www.wagamama.com/) - modern Japanese chain,
  soup noodle bowls, pan fried noodles, and some rice based dishes with fresh squeezed juices.
  Top picks here:
  - Starters:
    - Chilli Squid - coated in a light batter with a lovely sweet chilli dip - these are almost the same price as mains
      so relatively expensive yet everybody keeps ordering it's probably their best & most popular starter
    - Ebi Katsu - prawns in breadcrumbs with a great chill & garlic dip - be sure to ask for extra lime and drown the
      breadcrumbs in lime individually just before dipping them in the chilli and eating them for maximum impact!
    - Lollipop Prawn Kushyaki - marinated in lemongrass & chill - drown them in lime juice from the caramelized half lime
    - Chicken Yakitori starter
    - Gyoza are ok but not elite - the best ones are the crispy fried with duck filling and sweet cherry hoisin dipping
      sauce, followed by the steam chicken filled with chilli, soy & sesame dipping sauce.
      I haven't tried the new beef & kimchi ones yet
  - Mains:
    - Chicken Katsu Curry is a mild non-spicy sauce coating breadcrumbed chicken with white rice - easily one of the
      most popular dishes
    - Chill Chicken Ramen (soup bowl) - easily one of the most popular dishes - ask for it with Udon noodles instead of
      Ramen, they're better, and ask for extra lime for it.
      It is much better than the Grilled Chicken Ramen.
      There is also a beef variation but it's more expensive
    - Firecracker Prawn / Chicken - one of my favourite ever picks, but be warned it is seriously spicy!
      The prawn variation is better because the chicken requires more chewing so your mouth will get more burnt from the
      spice. Pro tip: ask for extra lime and drown it in lime to get maximum tastebud activation of spicy and lime
    - Prawn / Chicken Raisukaree Curry - mild coconut curry with rice and mangetout
    - Yaki Udon - pan fried udon noodles with chicken and prawns - simple but effective
    - Duck Donburi - teriyaki sauce coated shredded duck on white rice, not one of their bigger dishes, but tasty, so
      I used to order this when less hungry
    - Chicken & Prawn Pad Thai - for the less adventurous who just want some basic noodle dish - kids love this one too
    - Tantanmen Beef Brisket Ramen - korean bbq beef, it's ok, but mainly because you've already eaten the above ones
      too much and need something new becaues the kids make you take them here every weekend
  - Kids love the mini chicken yaki soba noodle bowl (ask for it with udon noodles instead it's better)
  - Drinks:
    - I like the Positive and High Five juices the most
  - Desserts:
    - Coconut Reika Ice Cream - 3 scoops of coconut ice cream with coconut flakes and passionfruit sauce, good to share
      in a couple
    - Banana Katsu - tastes great but it's two small pieces of banana and one scoop of vanilla ice cream - I wish it was
      bigger because I could eat 2-3 of these
    - White Chocolate & Ginger Cheesecake - very decent cheesecake
- [GBK - Gourmet Burger Kitchen](https://www.gbk.co.uk/) - good selection of big juicy burgers, good chunky fries, and
  milkshakes.
  I used to dine in the Soho branch weekly with my regular group of my foodie colleagues,
  and later when I worked at a less social investment bank I still got Kiwi Burger takeaways from here regularly.
  The menu changes slightly periodically, with occasional specials.
  The Habanero Burger used to be elite before they switched to overly sweet cost optimized Habanero Jam.
  The Kiwi Burger was another favourite with pineapple and eggs toppings, but they don't do it any more either.
  Please tell GBK to bring them back!
  The Taxi Driver, Texan, Rocketman or Gravy Train would be my remaining picks,
  or just try the basic Classic if not feeling adventurous.
  I'm not as keen on the chicken burgers here
- [Patty & Bun](https://www.pattyandbun.co.uk/) - one of my favourite burger chains, I used to get a takeaway from the
  Tottenham Court Road one every other day when I worked in the area.
  I loved their chips & dip, as well as their 3 main burgers, Ari Gold, Smokey Robinson and Jose Jose Chilli Burger
- [Honest Burgers](https://www.honestburgers.co.uk/) - another good burger chain.
  The chilli burger is my favourite here. I've been to the St Albans one outside London in the home county too
- [Wahaca](https://www.wahaca.co.uk/) - modern Mexican chain, I used to go to the Soho branch weekly with my colleagues.
  THe tacos are good sides/extra to have here.
  I used to like the steak and chicken mains, but it looks like they don't do them any more.
  I particularly like the Horchata sweet milk drink with cinnamon
- [Busaba](https://www.busaba.com/) - Thai chain, nice decor and food, portions and drinks not too big but nice
- [Joe & The Juice](https://www.joejuice.com/) - danish juice chain, good selection of fresh pressed juices, expensive,
  but we pay it so they are everywhere - I like the "Sports Juice" here, pineapple based juice with passion fruit and
  apple, as well as the classic "Go Away Doc" of apple, carrot and ginger
- [Burger & Lobster](https://www.burgerandlobster.com/) - their original gimmick was they used to price both their
  lobster and their burger at a flat £20, making it an expensive burger or an affordable lobster.
  Unfortunately, the lobster is now £40
- [Flat Iron](https://flatironsteak.co.uk/) - affordable steak chain, good for the price
- [Ippudo](https://www.ippudo.co.uk/) - Japanese
- [Nandos](https://www.nandos.co.uk/) - everybody loves Nandos peri-peri chicken chain,
  so like Wagamama, it's everywhere.
  Not as affordable as it used to be, but still not as expensive as some other places.
  The mixed olive starter is a popular choice here.
  The usual pick for mains is 1/2 chicken (or 1/4 chicken if not that hungry) with 2 sides of chips and rice.
  Drown the rice in Medium / Garlic / Wild Herb sauces, eat it,
  then use the rice bowl to pour the sauces in to heavily dunk each individual chip in for maximum flavour impact!
  For the experienced you can upgrade to Hot or XXX Hot but do not do this as a beginner
  because nearly all the sauces are more spicy than you would have at another restaurant
- [Roosters Peri Peri Chicken](https://www.roosterspiripiri.com/) - affordable peri peri chicken chain.
  Chicken wrap with fries and rice were my picks here
- [Nostimo Mediterranean Gastronomy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wmPzKGdA1TtJG5Pq5) - Greek, good quality, had the skewer
  plates which are good and come with major meats, chicken, pork, beef or lamb.
  The top 3 desserts on the menu were all good (Ekmek Kataifi, Portokalopita, Galaktompoureko).
  The bill racks up quicker than you'd expect here, and is not £10-20 as Google Maps suggests as the three of us blew
  nearly £50 per head without alcohol, which was a little pricey
- [Big Easy](https://www.bigeasy.co.uk/) - much better American BBQ than TGI Fridays
- [Pizza Express](https://www.pizzaexpress.com/) - good quality upmarket pizza restaurant
- [Pho](https://www.phocafe.co.uk/) - vietnamese noodle soup chain, like the Vietnamese Wagamama. Summer rolls and Pho
  soup are the obvious picks here
- [Zizzi](https://www.zizzi.co.uk/) - Italian restaurant chain - the Rustica pizzas are a good size here
- [Browns](https://www.browns-restaurants.co.uk/#/) - moderately upmarket brasserie chain of british food
- [Carluccio's](https://www.carluccios.com/) - mid-market Italian restaurant chain
- [Rosas Thai](https://rosasthai.com/) - Thai restaurant chain, passable, but independent Thai places are better for
  both food and price / value for money though
- [Dishoom](https://www.dishoom.com/) - modern Indian chain
- [Franco Manca](https://www.francomanca.co.uk/) - I'm not big on this chain, but some people like it for pizza
- [Banana Tree](https://bananatree.co.uk/) - south east asian chain
- [Bone Daddies](https://bonedaddies.com/) - well rated and they highly rate their bone broth, I don't recall rating it
  as highly

<!-- -->

<!--

- ~~Ichi Rikki~~ - great Japanese sushi restaurant with an excellent udon noodle soup, authentic and well priced, and
  their soft-shelled crab was good too.
  Shame it's permanently closed down.
  Damn London rents and unproductive fatcat landlords

-->

<!-- -->

- [Marks & Spencer](https://www.google.com/maps/search/marks+%26+spencer/) - not a restaurant but useful for picnic
  foods and belgian chocolate covered peanuts, which I used to be addicted to, and still buy a couple bags when in
  town...

<!-- Purl - my first date with Gemma - saved it only for her - shame it's closed down now -->

More upmarket (expensive) restaurants:

- [Dinner by Heston Blumenthal](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dpiPUpg9QDXEt47VA) - creative menu, unique
- [The Ivy](https://ivycollection.com/) - I took my ex-girlfriend to the one in Richmond, it was good.
  The scallops starter with pea puree stood out in my memory. Mains instead steaks, burgers and seafood
- [Yauatcha Soho](https://maps.app.goo.gl/P12FCb2DTgPei6Xh8) - upmarket Chinese with dim sum, the red fez desserts with
  edible gold on top were as tasty as there were impressive looking in the blue glass windows
- [Hakkasan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/J88xeebe9y5FUo3n7) - upmarket Chinese with dim sum and stylish decor
- [Gaucho](https://gauchorestaurants.com/) - upmarket Argentinian steak restaurant chain - very good - I recommend you get the Fillet
  Mignon medium rare (it's the most tender, leanest, highest quality steak).
  It still doesn't have desserts after all these years, I have no idea why
- [Sticks n Sushi](https://www.sticksnsushi.com/gb/en/) - upmarket (expensive) sushi restaurant chain
- [Salt Yard](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uKhJrjkdyznutkQw5) - upmarket tapas, not cheap, I took my ex-girlfriend here when
  we were in the first few months of dating
- [Gordan Ramsey](https://www.gordonramsayrestaurants.com/restaurants-and-bars/) - the famous celebrity chef's
  restaurants are usually good, and while not cheap, not the most expensive in London either
- [Sake No Hana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hcr4okhpzNuoRKGs6) - sushi & cocktails - good but expensive. I took my
  ex-girlfriend here for our second date and blew around £300. Closed down now unfortunately
- [Hawksmoor](https://thehawksmoor.com/) - well rated steakhouse, I didn't think it was that special compared to the
  more unique restaurants above
- [Buenos Aires Argentinian Steakhouse](https://www.barestaurant.com/) - Gaucho is better
- [Julie's](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EZBf4R2S28GyGvdAA) - upmarket french restaurant at Holland Park

Not Recommended:

- [The Real Greek](https://www.therealgreek.com/) - the worst blandest least authentic Greek food I ever had. Don't
  waste your money or one of your meals on this mediocrity
- [Bill's](https://bills-website.co.uk/) - mediocre burgers, don't go unless you have no other choice
- [Cote](https://www.cote.co.uk/) - didn't like their chicken, for the price you can eat a lot of better places. I don't
  get the appeal or niche of this chain
- [Yo Sushi](https://yosushi.com/) - it used to be a lot better, I used to go often, now it doesn't seem worth the
  price, especially as they removed a the seafood udon soup which was one of their best dishes
- [Itsu](https://www.itsu.com/) - mediocre Japanese chain, don't bland yourself to death..
  It's not terrible, it's just that you could eat better or for less elsewhere now
- [TGI Fridays](https://www.tgifridays.co.uk/) - mediocre American chain.
  For this money, you could get better variations at places like Big Easy.
  Not worth the damage to your health or your wallet

A couple of my other favourite independent places like [Ichi Ricki](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3zM4cY9M4fPEZYbM9),
Po Cha korean bibimbap at Tottenham Court Road, Ping Pong upmarket dim sum chain, are permanently
closed down, as are other notables Shaka Zulu and Sake No Hana. Damn London rent prices, the big chains are taking over.

### USA

You will get finger printed entering the country.

I've worked up and down that Los Angeles part...

![How Rest of World Sees USA](images/how_rest_of_world_sees_usa.jpeg)

#### California

California, the once golden place is not what it used to be after doubling its population from mass immigration.

Weather is great though, restaurants are decent (London's restaurants are better though).

Many of these places are only places to go on company expense as the hotels will set you back quite a lot per night.

Americans are now fleeing the failing Democrat state for Texas, which will then become the next domino to fall.

[In-and-Out Burger](https://www.in-n-out.com/) is a popular burger chain local to California, considered better than your
average chain by many locals.
The _"animal fries"_ covered in fried onions and gravy was too much even for me though.

- [Irvine](#irvine)
- [Los Angeles](#los-angeles)
- [Palo Alto](#palo-alto)
- [San Diego](#san-diego)
- [San Francisco](#san-francisco)

##### Irvine

A nicer more suburban manufactured city than LA, with decent shops and restaurants.

##### Los Angeles

A giant square grid of blocks. From the plane it looks like The Matrix.

Hollywood boulevard is nothing fancy in the grand scheme of things.
It's just a tourist strip of a few restaurants and shops.

Rodeo Drive is the upmarket shopping road of expensive designer brands.

Beverley Hills are not as fancy as one would believe from Beverley Hills Cop movies.
More like a $1M+ middle class area.

[Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ](https://lucillesbbq.com/menu) is the best BBQ I've had in the entire world.
I've been searching for a BBQ place to match it across countries for over a decade now and nothing has come close.
The warm apple-cinnamon bun starters are amazing as are the giant beef ribs with the best BBQ glaze I've ever had.
My colleagues and I drove half way across LA to go to this because everybody knows it is the best.
If you're in LA or one of their expanded locations, do not miss it.
Looks like they now have a couple branches in Vegas and one in Phoenix, Arizona too.

[Crustacean](https://crustaceanbh.com/menu/) in Beverley Hills is a good upmarket seafood restaurant with fish in the
see-through floor as you enter. Impressive. Recommended if you want something a bit more upmarket.

##### Palo Alto

A tech hub town with serious tech millionaire money, as evidenced by things like the McLaren showroom.

It was the first place I ever recall seeing a Tesla in 2013. When the traffic lights turned green,
for a moment I thought our car wasn't even moving relative to seeing it take off and leaving us behind in our
Infinity Q37.

Quite nice area, if you can afford it.

##### San Diego

A somewhat more chill city than Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Restaurants were not that cheap though.

##### San Francisco

Too expensive for even most of my engineer colleagues at Cloudera to live in.

There were homeless people on every block in 2013 when I was there. It's apparently much worse now.

Beware if you walk just one block west of the central shopping district you'll end up on the road of Tenderloin
which is full of drug addicts in broad daylight.
Walking through a group of 4 drug addicts on the pavement is not a pleasant experience
even if you think you could take them.
Not recommended for women.

[Boudin](https://boudinbakery.com/) is a local chain famous for its sour dough bread and soup in bread bowls.

### Vietnam

#### Taxis in Vietnam

If you haven't already set up your card to prepay on the Grab app, you'll need cash.

- [Grab](https://www.grab.com/) - taxi app

#### Hanoi

Don't got to Hanoi in the winter - it is not Thailand, it is cold and you will need a jacket due to the high lattitude.

- [Mình ơiii!](https://maps.app.goo.gl/863GxZHZ6r25ocM69) - small venue, summer rolls prawn were sold out,
  udon noodle pork soup was small but great, and the spring rolls come very hot fresh and crispy, fair prices too
- [Saltfee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hXC6XCDmBDemKJAV9) - the Guaberry iced tea is very nice, has wifi and a
  small balcony overlooking the street on the upper level
- [Hidden Alley](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uCTs4Xji1J4kubf47) - hidden gem, great interior with low lighting,
  interesting menu and wifi
- [Laika Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DNCerEaNfxDj1J2h8) - interesting drinks menu, outdoor terrace seating and wifi.
  The plum / passionfruit ice cream teas with jelly pieces was surprisingly good!
- [Puku Cafe & Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/srUuuBWUHQN8KDKn7) - 24x7 with wifi and reasonable prices, the stir fried
  beef noodles are really good, and also the peach iced tea or orange lemongrass peach iced tea with peach slices in them
- [Aroi Dessert Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YDd36mNVNmnx84zYA) -
  open 24 hours with good upper level seating as well as street seating, not only until 10:30pm as Google says.
  The `Aroi Dessert Cafe` wifi runs out of IP addresses, ask them for the password for the `Aroi Staff` wifi instead
- [Le Monde Steak](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C3AZkhWGYY7CfUAo8) - steaks, pasta, good drinks, reasonable prices and wifi
- [Hong Haoi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tHagvFRbC1Ugm9dJA) - popular restaurant in Old Town, small and busy
  The recommended fried fish is good and the juice is fresh squeezed,
  although not big (uses those milkshake glasses that are narrow at the bottom).
- [Don Duck](https://maps.app.goo.gl/joEGkujXGGJo4Nrq8) - small popular affordable restaurant specializing in duck.
  Reasonable prices, but the spring rolls weren't crispy and the duck soup while very affordable could have had better
  cuts of duck and less duck skin. Still for this price one shouldn't complain

#### Ho Chi Minh (formerly known as Saigon)

I much prefer this to Hanoi, it is ~1000km south with much better weather, better tourist areas,
but more expensive to eat and drink there.

[District 1](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HM1EcK3Tnrf25aR4A) is where you want to stay here.

- [Ben Thanh Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SePL2UKPEa75bHo16) - indoor market with food, juices, clothes, souvenirs
  etc. Eat here, it's much cheaper than most restaurants in the area
- [Đ. Bùi Viện](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ydZUkM2HUPgdwt7r5) - Walking Street of bars, clubs and restaurants. Buzzing,
  but expensive. Eat elsewhere, stop here for drinks and dancers
- [Ben Nghe Street Food](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JuWedMQJtq9JKjwQ8) - international mix of street food vendors, twice
  the price of the cheap eats places in Ben Thanh Market, but more variety and better social benches seating
- [The Hungry Pig](https://maps.app.goo.gl/W5KcfRHYC9jFLiYi9) - very good full english breakfast, paninis, burgers,
  big drink sizes, reasonable prices. The bacon is well done just the way I like it, in both the english breakfast and
  panini. The 'Fish & Chips' is more like fish goujons and chips, and smaller portion than a grand Fish & Chips of
  England. This is my favourite place for breakfast
- [Little HaNoi Egg Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XjfTPMq31ci2xJf86) - eggs, salmon, avocado type breakfast, good
  drinks such as peach ice tea with peaches in it
- [Quán ăn Bác Hiền](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hKbmBcmTAdyyXKzm7) - excellent cheap street food restaurant, ignore the
  mediocre Google rating, the locals eat and socialize here, you will eat and drink well for less than everywhere else
- [Chez Mimosa Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3ohXRm9hDWdbLRRL7) - affordable 3 course breakfast with a drink included,
  good quality, has wifi
- [Kyobashi Sushi Izakaya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3RAoMiRfzMuvHKRh8) - very good quality, soup noodles, sushi, skewers
  moderately priced, in thhe area of bar girls where you will seconded everywhere
- [Acai Bliss](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eUyM3zA7J8d2nuxE6) - acai bowls for around £5, good by international standards
  but expensive for here, was quite Sunday midday, and a bit of a walk from the main areas
- [Pure Bowls](https://maps.app.goo.gl/c7QKZc6f4fukao1x9) - another acai bowl place near Ben Thanh
- [Codonut](https://maps.app.goo.gl/z6P2dpn1nGb8goeb8) - coconut ice cream falvours in coconut bowl, with toppings,
  open late until 1am for late night treats, with seat both inside and on the street to people watch
- [Melbourne Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F7CbiqbHkB3en9kQA) - good mixed juices, English breakfast, pancake stacks,
  wifi, moderate prices, vietnamese food at the back of menu is cheaper
- [Me In Noodle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FjkCyUYhGCk9inxb8) - next to Ben Thanh Market, very interesting noodles menu,
  twice the price of the cheap places inside the Ben Thant market hall but full busy with foreigners,
  and the adjacent Mama's Kitchen restaurant has a different menu and also full
- [Hello Saigon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VNXgnuDVmC1VyD1u5) - good food, reasonable prices,
  the seafood crispy taro salad is good but cold, the mango and peach teas are too sweet despite asking them to reduce
  sugar and second time around no sugar, must be due to lots of syrup
- [Chez Gilbert Saigon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/z4LGFADNZZauuWrA6) - has breakfast / lunch deal specials, but they're
  not as big and filling as the above places. Good if you need wifi though
- [Xèo Restaurant - MeKong](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xWnpeWFSWwf1ygWZ7) - good food, reasonable prices, seafood rice
  noodles were very tasty, portion could have been a bit bigger but then I’m probably just greedy
- [Kyobashi Sushi Izakaya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cJYkDmYnLzmE6hTRA) - high quality Japanese restaurant, very good
  good with reasonable prices, serving noodle soups and a great selection of sushi and grill skewers, slightly off the
  beaten track in the alleys with lots of bar girls
- [Vincom Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fn87yQusZTwmsZMJ8) - shopping center with a lot of good looking restaurants
  on the lowest floor. Will be pricier than Ben Thanh Market
- [SIPFÉ coffee & sweets](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f3vBwFMg1XvLEhqu7) - fancy coffee place, nice drinks. Lots of girls
  dressing up and having their friends take pics of them due to the nice surroundings
- [Antiko Kafe 24/7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2eMS2EFFkAbipvgS8) - 24 hour student cafe, 3 floors.
  Tropical iced tea was good and full of fruit.
  There is lots of seating, wifi, plugs, lots of students there at midnight
- [Phê La - Hồ Tùng Mậu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wBQrLuBZRovBHpp67) - busy coffee shop with big teas, wifi and lots of
  seating upstairs, many people are on laptops there, and there are plugs to charge. Ignore the mediocre Google rating
  and look at how busy it is with mainly locals...
- [Maan+ Coffee & Tea](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TgbhdK8oPWzaYbgV7) - popular late night tea / coffee place used mainly by
  locals with lots of street seating, open until 2am
- [KOI Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qu4B3oRg2jptfkMRA) - opposite the Saigon center mall.
  Bubble tea shop on ground floor, coffee shop on 1st floor, seating on 2nd floor for teas from ground floor.
  Wifi code required from receipt (10 digit integer) for 120 minutes (this seems stingy compared to other coffee shops)
  and the plugs do not hold the adapters. Not as good as Phe La down the road
- [7 Bridges Craft Beer Taproom & Restaurant / Lê Thánh Tôn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gNu4NjdCwXFotyqh6) -
  drinks downstairs, cosy restaurant on 3rd floor, good for a date
- [Go2 Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9JRJdoUwsQZ3JKj8A) - listen to the live music from Lost in Saigon across the street
  at a more comfortable distance and volume, and the drinks are cheaper too. People watch the entrance to Walking Street
- [Carmen Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/66UqEuGme1PBFdo39) - expensive romantic bar with live music, use this only for
  dates, it is opposite and alongside expensive high end luxury hotels
- [YOYO BEER GARDEN Hồ Con Rùa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e2CTUE1vqqh7NHF7A) - banging and full at night, mostly locals
- [Quan Pho Con Bo Vang](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gibc8HohmBNtcSUB7) - cheap local eats place
