I've used Saily and aloSim apps for e-sims in Jordan.
The Airalo 3GB one is only 3 days, not 7 days like with the other providers, so watch out that one is too short.

The plugs are UK (type "G") plugs, but take a travel adapter just in case there are a variety of plugs.

## Jordan Visa & Jordan Pass

**Buy a Jordan Pass before you enter Jordan to avoid the visa entry fee**

You need a visa to enter Jordan, even with a UK passport.

The visa costs 40 JD (Jordanian dollars, €49) and can be obtained at the airport on the left just before you reach
passport control.

However, since historical attractions will set you back nearly the same amount again, you would be better off buying a
[Jordan Pass](https://www.jordanpass.jo/) which will cover the visa and the entry of the historical sites.

The difference between the 3 different Jordan Passes is whether you want to spend 1, 2 or 3 consecutive days visiting
Petra.

Carry your passport with you as ID may be requested upon entry to sites,
especially at Petra if using the multi-day petra pass.

## Cash & "Visa" in Jordan

Although many places do accept cards, quite a few don't so you will need to withdraw cash from an ATM otherwise you
will likely be caught out at some point.

Locals tend to say "Visa" when they mean card payment, your Mastercard will work fine too.

## Jordan Taxi Apps

- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/jo/en/) - reliable and more accurately priced than Careem, at least in Jordan in my
  experience
- [Careem](https://www.careem.com/) - cheaper than Uber on app, but the drivers usually charge you more than advertised
  and the app itself doesn't let you cancel a taxi after 2 minutes without charging you a penalty.
  I've also had drivers be unreliable and then have to contest the cancellation charges when they don't arrive
- [Jeeny](https://www.jeeny.me/en/) - expected a mobile number from one of the middle eastern countries, couldn't use it

Unfortunately these aren't allowed to operate in Aqaba or Petra / Wadi Musa so there you'd have to haggle with the local
taxi drivers.

## Beware Dating Apps Are Full of Scammers in Jordan

There are literally signs on the walls of local accommodations to not use dating apps because they are full of scammers.

If you speak to locals, normal girls from good families do not use dating apps,
as it is not a hook up culture but a family dating for marriage culture.

Scammers match and then arrange dates to "coffee" or "juice bars" that turn out to be shisha bars that overcharge
hundreds of JD through a combination of very expensive drinks, cover charges etc, and then demand payment.

I met a german guy who fell for one such scam and ended up losing 550 JD (€666).
To put this into context, in Jordan you can eat street food for 1 JD or have a steak in a high end hotel restaurant for
15 JD - so this sort of charge is outrageous - you couldn't rack this up even at 5 star hotel restaurants.
He said he met her on Bumble, and that after running up an unexpectedly huge bill, two guys from the establishment
escorted him to the ATM to enforce payment in cash.
The bar was also not even on Google Maps
(for obvious reasons in hindsight as people would give it 1 star scam reviews
and then subsequent people would not enter it).

## Amman

The capital of Jordan.

There are a couple of few historic sites dating back to Roman times -
the Roman forum, and the Citadel with the ruins of the Temple of Hercules.

Amman has also lots of good restaurants at reasonable prices, especially around
[Rainbow Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Dcj9De8Tso5D4SMdA) and
[Jabal Al Lweibdeh](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RjNi8Y8pgmAfbsha6).
Meat is widely available and affordable,
and there are even a few japanese restaurants, although they are relatively expensive compared to the other restaurants.

The city has lots of large hills with steep inclines and large public staircases, which will tire you out a lot.
My friend started ordering Uber taxis everywhere even a few minutes walk away just because he was struggling with all
the hills.

The city is not great for walking, you can't even walk north from the Taj Mall because it is just dual carriageways.

The roads are also surprisingly dirty (that black dust as opposed to litter) similar to parts of London.

Overall, you don't need more than 2-3 nights in Amman.

### Bus from Airport to Amman

The airport is quite a long way outside Amman - it's a 40 minute drive.

The Sariyah bus from outside the terminal is the cheapest way to get into the centre.
It only costs 3.30 JD (Jordanian dollars, €4) and will take you the bulk of the way almost as quickly as a car since
there are very few stops.

You can buy a ticket at the booth just outside the airport exit and they accept card and contactless payments.

You can then use public transport within Amman or take a taxi a shorter distance using one of the taxi apps above.

The taxi from the North Bus station to the centre was relatively cheap, Careem quoted 3.50 JD (€4.50), although it came
to nearly 4.5JD (€5.50), compared to the 30-35 JD quoted on Careem and Uber apps respectively from the airport as I'd
done most of the distance on the Sariyah bus and probably also avoided airport premium / levies.

If exiting the North Bus station to catch a Careem taxi for the last part of the journey,
you should take the south exit stairs up a few steps and then down to the motorway and then turn left and follow the
bend round as the nearest pickup point is there in front of a restaurant down there, and perhaps head down there before
calling the taxi on Careem as you don't want the driver to lose patience and cancel the ride as happened with my first
taxi while I figured how to get down there.

### Restaurants in Amman

<!--

Nomads Hostel / Hotel is a 5 minute walk from Rainbow St and just under £10 a night for a 4 bed mixed dorm en suite.

Caroub hostel is north of Jabal Al Lweibdeh,
but the large steep sets of stairs in between are very annoying and tiring, so not the best location, I prefer Nomad
and Sydney hostel locations near Rainbow St.

-->

- [Aima Ice Cream](https://maps.app.goo.gl/syQGJgzawKtsD5iS9) - 2 scoop cup for 1.75JD, 2JD if you get a big fancy cone.
  Much better priced than the Gerard Ice Cream chain you'll find on Rainbow St and elsewhere.
  They also let you try flavours before you buy,
  I liked the Rose (which has pistaccio green chocolate on its surface) and the cherry frozen yoghurt.
  The mango and chocolate are also good, as is the blueberry frozen yoghurt.
  Wifi 20/19 Mbit/s
- [Rainbow St.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F53XGxxLvwzPKUbw7) - full of restaurants
  - [Mijana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kmK8fd9AsQwvo9jj7) - upmarket restaurant with excellent menu, spacious shisha table
    seating on ground floor and nice rooftop seating, although the music in the evening was a bit loud.
    The food itself was top notch, from the lebanese sausages with pomegranate mollasses,
    to the fattoush, to the mixed grill, everything was good.
    The steak sandwich had good solid beef strips,
    but also cream sauce and coated in cheese and soft bap base more akin to a hotdog bun than a "baguette"
    as a european would understand that word.
    It comes with skinny fries, ketchup and a small coleslaw.
    The blueberry cheesecake came stacked high, it might have been too much.
    Has wifi, but wasn't working consistently the second time I came here
  - [Kee Korey](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2kdDjMqL8TUqFTc78) - the bibimbap is very tasty,
    although could have more beef,
    but overall a very solid well balanced meal with lots of rice and vegetables and some beef and a fried egg.
    Make sure to thoroughly mix in the side sauce for great flavour.
    Good choice especially when you need a break from all the kebab and middle eastern food.
    The HoDduk traditional korean sweet pancake was smaller than expected, but very sweet and cinnamony,
    and comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream - good if you have a sweet tooth.
    I could skip the dessert next time, although they also have mochi, but it wasn't in stock
    Wifi 36/5 Mbit/s (first wifi network didn't work)
  - [Kebab felfel & sumac](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6YQdNnFMxbeLgZTy9) - madly popular takeaway, even after midnight,
    good quality fast food (it's not fast), with kebab wraps and cheeseburgers for 1 JD - an absolute steal
  - [Juice Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zj1MMNzJFFAMQM8s7) - fresh squeezed juices for 1.5-3 JD
  - [Manoushe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Xyc1qKVu7EUFPNDC9) - their chicken wrap is very good for only 2.50 JD, as is their
    chicken schawarma which is a little more basic, more meat, comes with fries
  - [Shawarma Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Mp5jwARNobnft8457) - shawarma and chips, with dips, cheap
  - [Firefly Burger Jabal Amman](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uZtJHS1Wr1Lmifc39) - the Angus burger has a solid slab of beef
    and is a very good size. I haven't tried the fries and I didn't see a wifi network related to the restaurant name,
    but the burger was very good - but then it should be at nearly 5JD it's more than double the price compared to the
    standard burger at nearly 2JD - it comes with cheese and the burger itself has a peppery taste
  - [Arcobaleno Pizza](Arcobaleno Pizza) - good pizza from a wooden oven - had the Calabria pizza with olive replaced by
    tomato - 5JD for a medium which is plenty for one.
    Closes at 1am in winter instead of 3am as Google Maps suggests
- [Jabal Al Lweibdeh](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cPtteZESTXE1qTuS9) - lots of gentrified coffees shops, shisha and small
  foodie places on the two roads west off the small _"Paris Square"_ garden in the roadabout
  - [We Farm](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3uutSnsmsk3Xxkym8) - excellent fresh juice place, expensive but worth it. They
    also have a variety of snacks which are overpriced, but focus on the juice mixes, they are second to none
  - [Rumi Cafe and Deli](https://maps.app.goo.gl/m52rwVAUD1MvoZxJA) - large corner cafe with outdoor seating and a
    great dessert menu.
    They have a decent selection of tea and coffee drinks,
    a good selection of fresh squeezed juices, and some brunch food.
    They don't have all the desserts every day, it depends on deliveries.
    Their best cake is the rose cake with saffron - they didn't have it the first time I went so I went back to get it.
    It was surprisingly soft and moist.
    The apple cake with cinnamon was decent too.
    Wifi 13/13 Mbit/s but it's capture portal with a generated 10 digit numeric code valid for 90 minutes per customer
  - [Lolita Cafe & Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DR4GUgftfjvDiYxy8) - Mexican restaurant with a good selection of
    mains, tacos, burritos and drinks.
    The cherry beef taco has just the right amount of sweetness from a tiny bit of cherry sauce,
    and an orange wedge to squeeze on it for extra flavour.
    The chimichurri chicken breast with mexican rice was really good,
    not too much chicken, the rice contains red kidney beans, served on a bed of lettuce,
    and there is a separate chimichurri sauce pot which was awesome and a bit spicy, I used it all up!
    The horchata cinnamon milk drink was as good as expected, and good to put out a bit of flame on the tongue.
    Wifi 26/29 Mbit/s
  - [Roe - Ramen, Dimsum, Sushi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eTd2U7CZUN5KmzCVA) - a bit pricier than neighbouring places to
    eat but when you need a break from arabic food -
    especially if you're going for sushi as there are platters up to 99JD.
    The brisket ramen is popular here - the broth is very good, but eggs noodles are nothing special, I wish they'd
    listened and given me the ramen noodles instead.
    The sauce on the beef brisket is overly strong so I recommend you mix it in to the soup.
    They also have ice cream mochi.
    No wifi
  - [Ciao Ciao](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kBms6EcSPZ1xFiRX6) - Italian with pizza and pasta.
    The Filetto Di Manzo steak strips with penne pasta and mushroom and onion was good.
    I had it with tomato sauce instead of cream sauce, and surprisingly it came quite spicy.
    Stonkingly fast Wifi 411/105 Mbit/s!
  - [Rolling Pin](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cfWRYfpBrsZ55h99) - small pizzeria, good quality pizzas and cheap,
    only 2.50 JD
  - [Oliva Pizza and Pasta](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rUKu1EoaydDx8djg7) - Italian.
    Their bolognese is fairly decent (not as good as mine obviously but we can't ask for miracles),
    with a peppery taste and comes topped with lots of finely shaved parmesan strands.
    The portion size is moderate, not too big, a mid sized plate.
    The tables have pink himalayan rock salt and pepper grinders as well as dried chilli flakes.
    No wifi
  - [Four Winters Ice Cream](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gjwwdDhUaJovJiz49) - small venue & expensive ice cream because they
    use frozen liquid nitrogen to solidify liquid ice cream on demand.
    The chocolate ice cream was reasonable, but not sure it was worth the price, and beware that prices while already
    high do not include sales tax which they add at the till.
    Aima Ice Cream further above is better for ice cream and less than half the price.
    They also have açai for 6JD which was good, not too sweet.
    No guest wifi (wifi is reserved for the till system only)
  - [Babel Supermarket & Liquor Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FpWEEFwAxLUn6R1G9) - stop to buy water here, they accept
    credit cards
- [Ayman Gingerize](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GwFzLTN7NAcrdQs37) - ginger based sparkling juice drinks and teas. No
  seating, takeaway only
- [Faisal Cafe - Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UPGmqLmu6qQXbcqX8) - the traditional mansaf dish of lamb and rice
  was decent, although the yellow rice was a bit bland.
  The rice in the chicken maqluba was far more tastey as it had been mixed/seasoned with some flavours
- [Khan Khediwe Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gMXxxJWsRyxHNK427) - quiet hotel restaurant on the 7th floor,
  respite from the hustle and bustle of the surrounding streets.
  The fattoush was decent and the muttabal eggplant dip was too, it came with bread (which came cold, my friend sent it
  back for them to warm it up).
  Service was slow so mains were skipped in favour of somewhere else as most of them look like a standard fair,
  only the veal with pistacchio might have been worth trying.
  37/45 Mbit wifi
- [Taj Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/x6F57XZzPB84bH8L6) - 2 levels of designer shops, nowhere near as "palacial" as its
  Google Maps portrays, it's just a mid-sized international brand mall - whoever wrote this needs to see Dubai Mall!
- [Abdali Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/c3JHe5iFz7FQoDq66) - I prefer the Abdali Mall overall in terms of layout, but
  the Taj Mall probably has more expensive brand shops
- [Abdali Boulevard](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LFiX4AhmcFKEZjjQA) - wall to wall restaurants and coffee shops
  - [Black Stacks](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9XYHokuGhcR6Te6c8) - the main Black Burger was ok but a bit pricey at 7.7JD
    once you add on tax which is not included in the price
    (for comparison Firefly Burger on Rainbow St was bigger, better and cheaper).
    The bun wasn’t great, I took the top of it off.
    Wifi connected but didn’t work

TODO:

- [Marleys restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2D2bbeYTapHveE7SA) - 4.8
- [Gerard Ice Cream Jabal Weibdeh](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KfCKE8t7cP7bJUk67) - 4.6
- [Hazourah Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fwSLdibrpQXp3UsZ9)
- [Jubran Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NQPTMWdy1Fk6jL3A6) - 4.8
- [Habib Beirut](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ceoNzgqJ8sxy4Lbd6) - 4.7 lebanese
- [BigT Burgers](https://maps.app.goo.gl/g8BVVAEAW3d93se3A) - 4.8
- [AlQuds Falafel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HqyoE5Emf86rKDFDA) - 4.5
- [Shawerma 3a saj](https://maps.app.goo.gl/upqzKVHQNJ3AaR9o8) - 4.4 cheap shawerma I'm told is good
- [Al-Quds Kafeteria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tJgxmqisGLHdZpek8) - 4.4
- [Satar Coffee House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SMdCyB6sHzaxhvgC6) - 4.5
- [Flour & Fire](https://maps.app.goo.gl/d4Y6FqTJUM8hdmRx9) - 4.8 bakery

Not recommended:

- [Mar Yohanna](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Cfb2XNUoQS6th35VA) - mediocre and overpriced Italian restaurant with large
  outdoor seating area, moderately expensive for Jordan.
  The spagetti al ragu was mediocre and they don't take card payments.
  Orange juice was ok but a bit small.
  They even charged 1.75 JD for table water 🙄 - which I didn't ask for -
  and is ridiculous as that's nearly the same price as a fresh squeeze juice - and not even a fancy mineral water,
  just one of those refill yourself bottles with whatever water.
  Wifi 20/10 Mbit/s
- [Pizza Turtles](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AoUiZj9Cv3WUY3cV6) - the pizza turtle special was awful,
  they put black and cream sauces all over it making it disgusting,
  and the pepperoni was sticking out vertically so it all burnt, and it was twice the price of the Rolling Pin pizzeria
  above.
  No wifi
- [Acai Time](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hZ5btqgxR9EE84LG9) at Abdali Boulevard - the Acai was too sweet, I didn't finish
  it. Should have gone to Pinkberry opposite instead to get a frozen yoghurt instead

## The Dead Sea

You really cannot swim in the Dead Sea - you just float around and paddle a little, ideally on your back.
Being ultra-floating actually makes it hard to stay standing as your ultra-buoyancy quickly upends you on to your back,
and there is a trick to being able to right yourself to standing (a big backstroke flap while planting your feet).

### Travelling to the Dead Sea

- rental car
- taxi
- minibus from Amman to the town Al Rama near the Dead Sea for 1 JD per person from the
  [Muhajireen Bus Station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F8RrRU7Q4yR6Kydy9)
  (which is really just a strip of road by the side of the dual carriageway with a few minibuses waiting).
  This is how the locals trvel and will save you about 25JD on taxi.
  You can then take a taxi from the drop off point in Al Rama to a Dead Sea resort

### Dead Sea Resorts - There Are No Good Public Beaches

**Do not waste your time on the _"public beaches"_, they look like a wasteland with no facilities and no tourists, just
locals trying to scam you**

Contrary to intuitive believe, there are no decent beaches you can just turn up to for free, and you really need a
resort with shower facilities as the sea really is that harsh.

Pre-arrange your resort visit ahead of time for a better price.

- [Holiday Inn Resort Dead Sea by IHG](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XzbMC5mKETufcuM88) - this is actually a 5 star resort
  contrary to what one might think of Holiday Inn being mediocre.
  It's 25JD entry per person for a day pass, which includes a towel, showers, swimming pools and private beach with the
  special mud to put on your body.
  The private beach closes at 6pm so go earlier in the day

TODO:

- [Crowne Plaza Jordan - Dead Sea Resort & Spa by IHG](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9WnteDVYvGYVbCVJ8) - you can arrange a
  day pass with lunch included for 35JD per person, but it's apparently 45JD per person if you just turn up without a
  pre-booking

Not Recommended:

- [Amman Beach - Dead Sea](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EwXMYADBFfHWcwNH7) - 10JD but the place is dead. Go to a proper
  resort
- [Family's Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4SKnoFsrZsZCzsUU9) - looked permanently closed and abandoned
- Any of the _"public beaches"_ - see note above

## Petra & Wadi Musa

<!--

[Nomads hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jQXn2sCKtXXTP4yGA)
is recommended but was fully booked when I went.

[Petra Cabin hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rH9dtcsGqEDhzQ558) -
closer to Petra, but further from Downtown with the better food

[Rafiki hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DBk9D9g8QbVqzoyS9) was ok, but the kitchen was a bomb site of stalled out
renovation, and their little dog poos everywhere, including on the couch. Their wifi also doesn't work properly upstairs
in the room but works better in the lobby.

-->

The ancient archaeological site of one of the 7 Wonders of the World -
[The Treasury](https://share.google/a7U2bQY9ldd2p6V38)
where they carved the building straight out of the mountain rock.

Entry to Petra is around 50JD (€60) for a single day, so as per the section above, it's usually better to buy a Jordan
Pass which can cover 1, 2 or 3 consecutive days for negligible increase in price of 5JD per extra day.

**Carry your passport as ID may be requested, especially on the 2nd day if using a multi-day petra jordan pass.**

### Travelling to Petra

There is a Jett bus from Amman but which leaves at 6:30am daily, and a counterpart bus back to Amman that leaves Peta at
5pm, which is not enough time so you'll probably want a one night stopover in Wadi Musa.

You will need to book a ticket at the website below at least 2 days in advance as they sell out.
Select Amman Daily Tours from the drop-down:

<https://www.jett.com.jo/>

Otherwise you'll need a rental car or a very expensive taxi ride. Most people use the Jett bus.

### Attractions in Petra

**Carry your passport as ID may be requested, especially on the 2nd day if using a multi-day petra jordan pass.**

**Take at least 1L of water per person and a lunch box.**

You can do Petra in one day, but you'll be worn out, it's easier to do it over 2 days.

You may want to go very early in the morning before the midday sun, Petra opens at 6:30am.

From the main entrance, and especially if you only have 1 day in Petra, I would prioritize seeing:

- [Al-Siq](https://maps.app.goo.gl/u9t4nkyR7CjYs77d8) - the natural passage through the rock on the way to the Treasury
- [The Treasury](https://maps.app.goo.gl/m4Q7QXFkLpXZCQraA) - the famous building carved out of the rock
- [Ad-Dayr](https://maps.app.goo.gl/U4Bkt4aZngRM5wm56) - the monastery at the top of the mountain, also carved out of
  rock

You will pass the
[Djinn Blocks](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wUY7c9Q8KaK8wjNu6) and
[Obelisk Tomb & Bab as-Siq Triclinium](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AeS7LeNVqtDGKfeL8) on the main route in/out of Petra
where [Al-Siq](https://maps.app.goo.gl/u9t4nkyR7CjYs77d8) and
[The Treasury](https://maps.app.goo.gl/m4Q7QXFkLpXZCQraA) are.

Optional:

- [Back Door hiking route to the Monastery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qhs6o9Cs9F1WYMsSA) - you can take a taxi to this
  back way in to do Petra in reverse so that you don't have to cover the same ground twice there and back out again
- [Palace Tomb](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fPxSBYVD3MGtzwUX8) - you can only view this on the outside as there are barriers
  preventing entry
- [Urn Tomb](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xG6tQawTipMGu5Yv9) - can enter but it's more impressive on the outside
- [High Place of Sacrifice](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iQyGox7D3ib6AXG6A) - a lot of effort to go up this mountain, not
  sure it's worth it

### Restaurants in Wadi Musa

The nearby town Wadi Musa itself is quite small,
and the restaurants on
[Tourism St](https://maps.app.goo.gl/geaNCD1SibVbkykAA) as you might imagine are tourist prices for mediocre food.

- [Downtown- Wadi Mousa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vTSThzGFEUhcJXEb8) - where locals go to eat rather than Tourism St -
  a good selection of restaurants and dessert places
  - [Juniper Falafel Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dUdsx3yfVsSmcyKi9) - cheap good quality local food
  - [Hashem affouri sweets](https://maps.app.goo.gl/y4FJiLRVUjwj4BhF7) - mousse cake (small round looks like cheesecake
    on my Insta) for a mere 1 JD
  - [Berry Cake](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1ppWGfYdv3wrYJuZA) - fresh orange juice or cheesecake for 2 JD
- [Banseok in Petra](https://maps.app.goo.gl/poafpNsSUBFGKvYZ7) - a long 45+ minute walk uphill out of town, you will
  want to take a taxi, but otherwise decent Korean,
  much needed if you're tired of kebab and falafel if you've been in the middle east too long.
  The beef bibimbap was a good size but didn't have much beef,
  but it came with an unexpected lot of side dishes included.
  The chives and onion pancake and the fried eggplant sides were particularly good.
  No wifi and their card machine was _"broken"_ so cash needed

Not Recommended:

- Anywhere on [Tourism St](https://maps.app.goo.gl/geaNCD1SibVbkykAA)
- [Falafel Time](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zYkcVBCWUu4zkFWd9) - the "camel burger" for 5 JD did not taste like camel but
  rather falafel with sugar added, and the patty had a crumbly dry texture not like meat but falafel - I would not try
  this again - either this was fake or the camel cubes below were fake, or both.
  The local receptionist at my accommodation told me that any camel would be 100% fake.
  At least the fries were good and crispy unlike at Mr Falafel below, and it wasn't such a rip off
- [Mr Falafel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NvoP2cAcMZD9UdUa9) - a blogger recommended this, but it was overrated. 12JD for
  "camel" cubes which were overcooked, tough and charred.
  The fries were soggy and the orange juice was smaller than quoted size, full of pips, blended pips and skin.
  Overall a waste of 15 JD -
  which could buy you a prime steak in an upmarket hotel restaurant in Amman,
  to put how bad value for money this place is in perspective

## Wadi Rum

Red-rock desert protected area, used to film Lawrence of Arabia and The Martian.

Some of the views of the mountain ranges are amazing, especially at sunset.

I was quite skeptical of going to a desert, but it is worth it for a one day jeep tour and to stay overnight.

If you only want to do a half day jeep tour, make sure it is in the afternoon for the sunset, rather than the morning.

At night you will see the sky full of stars due to the clear cloudless sky and less light pollution than urban areas.

For food, you will be mostly relying on your guide camp to feed you and provide bottled water. Your jeep should have a
cool box full of small water bottles.

**Make sure you take trainers with good grips as climbing the bridge will be dangerous otherwise.**

### Travel & Accommodation in Wadi Rum

- Jett bus from Aqaba:

<https://www.jett.com.jo/>

- Minibus from Petra - 10 JD - pre-arranged to pick you up from your accommodation in Petra
  and drive you to [Wadi Rum Visitor Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YwArSg5QLip8RjHH6) or
  [Wadi Rum Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mMmoQBZBoaZwQz1U6)
  (about 10 minutes drive apart), where your desert camp provider will often arrange to pick you up

My accommodation in Petra arranged this minibus for me, included as part of a desert tour and camp accommodation
package through them, which probably wasn't optimal but just made the planning easier.

I stayed at Bedouin Lifestyle camp.
The bungalos have keys to lock your valuables inside.
The tents are more like converted corrugated sheds and have loops on their sliding doors to use your own padlock on -
you should have your own medium sized padlock on you as per the hostel section near the beginning of this page.

If I was to go again,
I would rent a car and then pick the desert package and accommodation more specifically to ensure it's the best.

There are permanent tents in the desert camps which have communal showers,
and there are en-suite bungalos for additional cost.
It is also possible to sleep under the stars by special arrangement, but apparently this is more expensive.

It's ideal to go for 2 nights, arrive the night before, do a full day jeep tour the next day,
then stay overnight again before leaving so that you are resting properly instead of travelling to / from Wadi Rum on
the same day as the full jeep tour which is more tiring.

### Wadi Rum Village

[Wadi Rum Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aG3DosxCrydMmgeNA) is a small community of buildings.

Unfortunately, even here you will find a bit of street litter of cigarette packets and plastic bottles.

- [Enjoy rum Resturant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eeFHgFQ9wco95sxf7) - 7 JD cash only for 1/4 chicken on a bed of 3 types
  of rice, a side plain yogurt pot, and a small vegetable soup which was very tasty, accompanied by 2 quarters pieces of
  flat pita.
  It has negative Google reviews from tourists who say they got ripped off for 30 JD,
  but since the Rum Castle restaurant I'd intended to go to, as well as the Falafel takeaway, were both closed,
  I had to chance it - just ask and fix the price up front to 7 JD.
  Wifi 18/5Mbit/s

TODO:

- [Rum Castle Resthouse](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hih2zWL474ZSZ82TA) - not open at 3pm Monday, fridges were empty,
  not sure if permanently closed down
- [Falafel Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/54DiPSr4hBUM8SPG7) - not open at 3pm Monday

## Aqaba

City on the Red Sea, known for snorkelling and scuba diving.

Aqaba isn't big so you can explore it in one day, then spend one day snorkelling and another day scuba diving - a
3-4 night stay isn't enough, plus whatever rest days you want around travelling.

You can get to Aqaba either via plane since it has an airport, or just a Jett bus:

<https://www.jett.com.jo/>

<!--

The Extra Traveller hostel was nice, good facility and the owner is super friendly and accommodating.

### Travel to Aqaba

You can get to Aqaba by plane as there is a local airport, or by Jett bus from Amman:

<https://www.jett.com.jo/>

### Attractions in Aqaba

- [Al-Ghandour Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/57LYms5XXEVsvAdd6)
  - [Aqaba Cornishe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/r17BRpi2YWaHr6vT9) - park by the beach

- [Fish market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Vz5rQKMXk3VRuCmm9) - at sunset when fishermen are returning with their hauls
  there are gangs of cats waiting for small fish scraps, the little moochers 🥰

### Scuba Diving & Snorkelling in Aqaba

If you're a beginner, snorkel or especially scuba from the shore the first time to ease yourself into it.

Breathing underwater with scuba equipment is like visiting an alien environment where your brain may send
you contradictory signals that you cannot breath or you may panic or hyperventilate,
so you may need to start in shallow water to get used to it where you can stand up if you need a
reset before you get used to it and ease yourself into doing this at depth where you will not be able to easily exit if
you a problem with your breathing equipment.

Scuba diving from the boat should be done by more confident experienced divers as it is done to much greater depths
further out off a large yacht where you will see underwater planes and tanks, and while a more impressive experience,
if you panic out there in the deeper sea it could be very dangerous.

**You cannot afford to panic under the sea when scuba diving as you could take a lung full of water and drown.**

Even scuba diving off the shore there are coral reefs with fish, sea snakes etc to see, so while in Aqaba it is well
worth the experience to go.

In fact, scuba diving is probably _the_ thing to do while in Aqaba.

### Restaurants in Aqaba

- [Bakar & Sweets World Al janob](https://maps.app.goo.gl/onfk16d9E49Cn3m1A) - the best local bakery of breads and
  treats, shown to me by a local, open 24 hours a day!
  You can see them making these large flatbreads in front of you,
  and there is a 3 level conveyor belt of round pitas coming down, as well as selection of baklava and similar treats
  ready to pick up.
  I love the yellow "cake" bread, which wasn't sweet but had an amazing aftertaste -
  I was eating several of them a day and took an extra batch for my flight out!
- [Buzz St](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AosyXZmNTD43kZDRA) - several highly rated gentrified coffee shops
  - [Khubza & Seneya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3RHnqGAe6bjedf8S6) - highly rated arabic food and good prices -
    probably the most hihgly rated place in Aqaba in terms of number of reviews while maintaining such a high score.
    The cucumber yoghurt "salad" was basically Greek tzatziki with the right about of garlic, one of the best I've had
    in recent times.
    The mutabal eggplant-based dip was very good and lavished with pomegranate and a dark drizzle sauce.
    The mixed grill was good as expected, and tomato skillet with ground beef was decent too.
    The fattoush was possibly a bit too strong, depending on your mood.
    These dishes were more than enough for 2 people, don't let the staff convince you to get 2 mains, keep it meze
    style!
    They also have fresh orange and mango juices at very reasonable prices compared to neighbouring restaurants
  - [Watermelon Juice Corner](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ug9Gddk5KKbehxoF7) - excellent menu of fresh juices, juice mixes,
    but several of the mix drinks are not intuitive, with some being just three letter acronyms.
    The pineapple-coconut juice was good.
    The LPG (lemon, pineapple, ginger) was much too heavily weighted to lemon, don't get that one again.
    I told them the next day they need to put more pineapple for sweetness instead of lemon which made it too sour.
    The "cocktails" are non-alcoholic but with vanilla ice cream scoop!
    Has wifi
- [Aurjwan Cafe & Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zPZ1xEhVMkxPa7Xm7) - good menu and moderate prices,
  in a well air conditioned cafe lounge with indoor and outdoor seating, 5 big screen TVs on 3 of the walls playing
  football.
  The outdoor seating is covered during the day time as it's too hot and not shaded.
  The fish and "chips" was good - 3 medium sized pieces of nicely battered fish, 2 large lemons, and the homemade
  "chips" were like deep fried crisps rather than the fries expected.
  The banana split was great too - and came topped with strawberry slices and nuts -
  of the 3 scoops of ice cream, the chocolate was my favourite, a rich flavour of chocolate,
  followed by the vanilla, but next time I'd go with the strawberry instead of the mango sorbet.
  I'm going to try to have this banana split again.
  Wifi 382/177 Mbit/s
- [Flame](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zP1pSkaUTHQ5cmPv9) - good fast food burger restaurant.
  The smokey burger double was surprisingly good, and came with a lot of skinny fries and a soft drink
  for 6.25 JD (I asked for water instead).
  The special burger was too much due to the large think slab of deep fried cheese, the second half of which I pulled
  out, rather than ate.
  Go with the classic burger instead of the special if you're even remotely health conscious.
  No wifi unfortunately (it's only for the pay register)
- [Juice Corner by Lacosta](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qNX7yFnXcZRbkdN66) - high quality fresh squeezed juice bar with a
  great menu, reasonable prices and good selection of juices and fresh pure juice mixes as well.
  A plain orange juice is 2 JD + taxes, so a little cheaper than the neighbouring restaurants which are typically 3 JD.
  The juice mixes are typically 2.5-3 JD + taxes.
  Wifi is by the parent Lacoste Hotel tested at an impressive 286/212 Mbit/s
- [Lacosta Bakery & Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vsiJcdi78Nmcob6B8) - upmarket expensive coffee shop with treats like
  cookies and croissants filled with banana or strawberry and chocolate.
  Wifi same as above but tested at 75/94 Mbit/s
- [Sayd Al-Bahr – Seafood Food Truck](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pAWxBeXxV9unGT6E8) - affordable seafood street food with
  benches.
  I didn't rate the Mexican seafood as that good though.
  The fried seafood sandwich was better
- [Route65](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SiY6xpgv3gSk6qNU8) - popular gentrified burger restaurant, they quoted a long 25
  minute wait for the burger and fries, but it was only 12 minutes.
  The 65 burger was pretty basic, with a slice of pastrami, but not enough salad, fairly average fast food style burger.
  The curly fries were decent, crispy, but are an additional surcharge on the meal price.
  Wifi 118/82 Mbit/s
- [Captains restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HPawt9UGciw9SkbH9) - steak and seafood, relatively pricey and
  their fried fish while large is not as good as the crispy tempura at Aurjwan Cafe & Restaurant above
- [Fruit Salad Aqaba](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ovVDrdVF3Y2XYtjf7) - same fresh juice & fruit chain as in Amman section
- [Firefly Burger](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5XRz6wZXLqzrxxyQA) - same chain as the one described in the Amman section
- [Albaba Spices](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9VqbRBQsbfnBYyyq7) - 2-3 JD for 200-300g for spices, a great selection of
  mixed spices and teas, most notably the pomegranate tea mix,
  which they gave sample of as well as tastes of their various spice mixes which were very good.
  If you're intending to cook anything whether here or back home, you may want to get some of these mixes

  so had to order a side of rice (2JD, but it was large to be fair).
  The fresh orange juice was a decent but they insisted on charging 3JD even though I showed it was 2JD on the board
  outside.
