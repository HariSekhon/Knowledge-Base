If you have limited time, just do Siem Reap and skip the capital Phnom Penh, it has far better venues
and the Angkor Wat temple.

## Visa for Cambodia

You need an eVisa or you will have to queue for a $30 visa when you arrive.

## Money in Cambodia

Take lots of small denominator dollars, especially \$10 and \$1 bills.

Cambodia accepts USD but often gives change in local Cambodian riel, which is of course useless outside of Cambodia.

If you just go to the ATM machine, aside from being charged \$5 for a withdrawal,
your withdrawal notes will be in \$100 bills,
that'll result in your first dining bill returning nearly 400,000 Cambodian riels,
which if you're only visiting for a short time you may have trouble spending in time.

Also, be careful restaurants and other locals don't give you fake dollars back.
Street vendors will usually only give change in local Cambodian currency, riels.

## Taxis in Cambodia

Make sure to always use the Grab app, on the street they will charge you more, like most countries.

## Restaurants in Cambodia

Cambodia uses US Dollars so it is relatively expensive compared to Thailand or Vietnam.

For example, a holy chilli basil meat dish that would be \$2-3 in Thailand will cost you $6-7 here.
A coffee will cost you \$3-4.

Also, 'Fish & Chips' seems to be more like fish goujons and chips,
and not the grand portions you may be used to in the West.

## Phnom Penh

This capital is pronounced `puh-nom pen`.

Stay near the Royal Palace of Cambodia by the river, it's where all the bars and restaurants are.

If you stay in one of the places slightly West,
there is nothing much there and you'll lose 20+ minutes walking each way to the busy area, or have to take taxis.
They're cheap for a reason.

- [Phnom Penh Night Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/E9T7UUWrn3ZHKUve8) - affordable street food 6-11pm, and
  3 scoop ice cream in a half coconut for \$1.50 with 'free' coconut water
  (lol if it was free it would come without a purchase)
- [Bassac Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fGsvZB92EzwiH69p6) - tourist street of bars and restaurants
  - [Hub Street Cocktails](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KACt4g44R1fYQFEj6) - busy with locals and live music on Saturday
    night
  - [Mama Wong's Dumpling and Noodle House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ro2CqaBSfDB74gDn6) - one of my favourite places,
    very good dumpings (the bestseller pork, and the prawn & chive),
    the duck soup broth is flavourful with interesting thick yellow noodles,
    and the spring onion pancakes bestseller is surprisingly good but also fattening, if you're hungry, have it as a
    snack and you won't be afterwards.
    I was absolutely stuffed after 1 portion of dumplings (8 pieces) and one soup for $12 total.
    You will need multiple nights here.
    There are two dips, one of which is like a sweet vinegarette which is amazing
  - [CanCan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uZnpwB3s9C4HQgEp9) - loud, busy and popular, good menu, opposite Mama Wong's
  - [Big MaMa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QBeF2jJAWSzDaM1SA) - good menu, but pricey for Cambodia at $10-15 per main, most
    seating is on rooftop bar which was dead at 9pm on a Saturday night with just 2 individual single guys eating dinner
    there, while the street downstairs is buzzing with bars and restaurants
  - [Back Street Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9WQL6C8eEfw1S8qi8) - decent menu and good prices
  - [Bat Muk Yu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wr7R6NRY8B4PvUmE6) - popular beer garden with live music on Saturday night
  - [White Rabbit](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9gc11Ad8rKpfshVc6) - small cosy low light bar, good for an intimate date
- [Khemarak Phoumin Ave (130)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XHBLfD7MyiPYoECK9) - the east end is the red light district of
  bar girls, but there are also a few good hotels and restaurants places that cater to foreigners
  - [Gastro 130 Restaurant & Bar 24/7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TWWxsZ4wGN11L3Xs8) - very popular, well positions,
  good seating, a few plugs, can be loud at times, international priced menu
  - [Owl Cafe & Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/m4FLw8sHrSXx6ieY6) - slightly cheaper but still internationally
    priced by Cambodian standards of course
  - [La Croisette](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CUKpxpL4vz8ziqdd7) - fancy upmarket restaurant with a very good looking menu,
    but quite expensive at \$5-7 per non-alcoholic drink, at $10+ per alcoholic drink.
    Closes relatively early too at 11pm compared to surrounding places
  - [Lucky cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V8Js6PcqUu5AxJ3r8) - quiet cafe, good wifi, plugs
- [Oknha Chhun St. (240)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/78V82nktxEsjQ95L6) - upmarket cafes and small boutique shops
  - [Barista 240](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4NxEW5B6MPwJcn9r8) - expensive by local standards, more than the most
    expensive places in Khemarak Phoumin Ave above (eg. \$8.50 for a Full English breakfast compared to \$5.50-\$6.50),
    \$4.50 for a juice, but the food and drinks menus are excellent, it's air conditioned, with wifi
    Extras like eggs are $1.50 each, which is triple what other places charge
  - [Melbourne Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SZc2oZCPy8uKLG3Q7) - good smoothies and toasties,
    double the price of Cambodian street food of course because it caters to foreigners. Fast wifi and plugs
  - [Planta](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uwWWd9ZgJ42z4HSq5) - excellent Acai smoothie with chewy bits, expensive at $4.50
    by local standards but so good I went back the next day for another one.
    Unfortunately dining in the glass is smaller than the plastic takeaway cup.
  - [Enso Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5PC7pkcEjC9ohA9P6) - upmarket cafe with good food menu, pricey but has lunch deals
    for $11.50
  - [Num Kruk](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pq3tASLWa4BTe12z9) - street food stall of very good beef Pho with a smell of
    cinnamon, which stopped me in my tracks and got me to try it for $2.50, between The Royal Palace and Melbourne Coffee
- [Royal Palace of Cambodia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4DKHab79NUWV1WL46)
  - [Café Amazon Riverside](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EZz94RLyn7Q3U6CM9) - popular coffee chain near the palace with decent
    wifi and plugs. Drinks are $2.50+, internationally priced

## Bus Between Phenom Penh and Siem Reap

This is the cheaper way to get between the two cities, it takes 5 hours, but has wifi, USB power sockets and
comfortable seats.

- [Viet Air Bus Express](https://vetairbus.com/en/transport/Phnom%20Penh/Siem%20Reap)
- [Giant Ibis Bus](https://www.giantibis.com/)

When booking seats if you want to sleep on the coach bus, or just find horns annoying, do not sit at the front,
the driver will honk the horn every 2 minutes when passing any vehicle or bike to warn them.

## Siem Reap

Resort town with the Angkor Wat temple...

_"You what mate?"_ Yeah this name confused me
when I first heard it audibly by an English cockney I met at the airport and hung out with for a couple days.

- [Jungle Burger Sports Bar and Bistro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6zqh9xV8dqqn51HL7) - Excellent menu, stylish venue with bar, tables, memorabilia all over the walls, and sports on big TV screens.
  Absolutely rammed at 7pm on a Saturday and for good reason. Wifi 45Mbit/s and plugs.
  Burgers are obviously the speciality here, with thick dense high quality patty, absolutely stuffing.
  I also recommend the big Jungle Juice.
  Open 7am - 10pm, great Breakfast burgers, and full English breakfast,
  which is the most expensive I've seen in Cambodia at \$7.99 but looks awesome
- [Footprint Cafes](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DB2DMSPwX2mEpR1f9) - fast wifi, comfortable padded chairs, plugs, books,
  cool downstairs, perfect working place, wifi 80-90Mbit/s, juices are small and expensive at \$3.50, smoothies same
  price, but overall it's great, and has food at reasonable international prices.
  Closes at 8pm so it's really a day place.
- [New Leaf Eatery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/o8fKjtjVAZMCgXjz7) - gentrified cafe (expensive) catering to westerners,
  internationally priced but good quality, has WiFi and plugs. The full English breakfast is good, the house limeade is
  refreshing and not sparkling,
  the apple & mango pie with chocolate ice cream was a step too far though,
  fattening, I ran up nearly a $20 bill here which for Cambodia is a *lot*
- [The Source Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5u7cKcTZYoNhdhBT6) - gentrified western cafe with wifi and plugs,
  reasonably comfortable seating, but closes early at only 5pm,
  has milkshakes (not common enough in Asia IMO).
  The Source Breakfast is basically a Full English breakfast except with spinach instead of sausage, quite good.
  The milkshake on top of it was a step too far, I was waddling around stuffed all afternoon. 50-60Mbit/s wifi
- [The Muffin Man](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mdAc5auh7kzZG9my7) - air conditioned cafe with gluten free muffin and cake
  options, lime juice was really good, chilled and refreshing.
  Wifi but the power plugs didn't work along the whole left wall as you enter
- [Wat Bong](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YHtNRxo2qcDTZEcC8) - good burger and fries \$7.50, fresh coconut \$1.50
  (don't have two, it's a laxative, you'll need to rush back to your hotel room), wifi and plugs
- [My Little Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aX6FwCC3EctXfw4V6) - cheapish, moderate English breakfast,
  cheaper local dishes,
  cheap drinks, \$1 coconut, \$2 juice, \$2.50 cocktails.
  The Khmer Muslim Beef Curry was far too sweet IMO. The beef was around 40% fat,
  but I have a sweet tooth and even I thought the sweetness was far too much,
  betraying the addition of too much sugar addition,
  which for the best cuisine should usually have plausible deniability
- [Sister restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mi68RoFDfH33JDJo9) - affordable local eats place, $3 beef skewers (x3)
  with vegetables and rice was great, didn’t like the lemon ice tea though (which I usually do, IMO it tasted weird).
  Has wifi and plugs
- [Biolab Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RGPWHKoW5Us8CGrm9) - upmarket cafe with good but pricey drinks, and reasonable
  priced food menu.
  Very nice interior, especially on the upper level (although that closes earlier around 8pm, instead of 10pm for the
  smaller downstairs). Low level ambient piano music, wifi and plugs available.
  A single meeting room is available although IMO expensive at \$10 per hour or \$80 per day (especially for Cambodia)
- [Temple Coffee n Bakery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N2M3qPxDH3hER5xQA) - large two story unit on a prime corner location,
  large menu but pricey at \$3.75 for a juice, fast 50Mbit/s wifi, closes at midnight
- [Try Me](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gANdR1r9M1jhpq496) - reasonable quality, internationally priced, Fish amok was ok, but \$4.50, pineapple juice \$2,
  3x vegetable samosas were nice and crispy $1.50 my fav of what I had. Has wifi
- [The Red Piano](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gSUUduQpHCKdf7rKA) - price location at the central crossroad of Pub Street
  (their version of a Walking Street in Thailand or Vietnam).
  Better priced than opposite places, but shuts a little earlier at 00:30.
