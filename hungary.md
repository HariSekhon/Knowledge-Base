### Hungary

#### Avoid northern counties

Do not drive through the north Hungarian counties, there are serious ghettos that feel very unsafe:

#### Taxis in Hungary

- [Bolt](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bolt-request-a-ride/id675033630)
- [FoTaxi](https://fotaxi.hu/en/passengers/taxi-application/) - local alternative

#### Motorway Tolls - Vignettes in Hungary

Hungary requires online tolls to be pre-paid before using its motorways to avoid a fine. 🙄

You must buy it before you travel as there is only a 60 minute grace period upon entering a motorway.

You can buy it online but prices vary a lot between €16-24 - this site was reasonable:

This had a lower service fee:

#### Budapest

Good for a long weekend city break with the girlfriend.

Don't bother going outside of June - August. The weather was miserable even at the end of May.

##### Metro in Budapest

Budapest metro is surprisingly cheap and good. It's 450 HUF for a single journey ticket which works out to only 95p!

Download the [BudapestGo](https://bkk.hu/en/tickets-and-passes/budapestgo/) phone app
and you can purchase tickets
and scan the QR code to validate them at the entry points of the Metro.

The Metro shuts down around 11:30pm so don't stay out too late or you'll need a taxi.

##### Restaurants in Budapest

I felt most of the restaurants I tried in the 4.5 star region were overrated, as well as western priced,
with exception of Caviar & Bull and Grand Central Cafe which were high quality.

- [Caviar & Bull](https://caviarandbull.hu/menu/) - an amazing dining experience to take the girlfriend if you're in the mood to drop £300 on a
  fancy night out. The food is easily among the best I've ever had around the world, with little chef treats of unusual
  things sent to us to try that I can't name but were all amazing
- [Centrál Grand Cafe & Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eMTeLshhMZSKJMrc9) - high class venue with live piano music and
  live violin, at least on the Saturday night I was there.
  Good drinks menu with a selection of interesting coffee based drinks, teas, fresh juices and alcohols.
  The food menu is similarly decent with good breakfast options with eggs benedict / royale, croissants, steak, salads,
  desserts etc.
  The fresh green juice was good (spinach-kale-apple-cucumber-lemon) and
  red juice (beetroot-red grape-ginger-orange-lime) are both great.
  Apricot and passion fruit tiramisu aws excellent in both presentation and flavour.
  Prices are moderately high but not high-high as one would expect for the class of the establishment.
  Definitely take your girlfriend here. 7/3 Mbit/s wifi
- [1000 Tea](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Be4a8HKNCweckq1M7) - excellent tea house with teas from around the world.
  Expensive though at £5 for a tea for one. 11/17 Mbit/s wifi, no password
- [Say Cheese](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HpJAcZFa66RNmieV7) - coffee and brunch, good menu with everyting from eggs to
  pancakes, bagels, and even an acai smoothie bowl.
  The eggs royale (poached eggs and salmon on muffin) is good, albeit not large, and sprinkled with pomegranate.
  The acai bowl is not very acai, it's diluted, but with the granola and fruit and nuts, is still good and worth having.
  562/51 Mbit/s wifi
- [Madal Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CSpgybKJECvzfZv39) - the chai latte is good, not very sweet, small venue
  downstairs but there is more seating upstairs. 35/0.2 Mbit/s wifi
- [Lumen Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XBNhrJ6DjmpSyMcZ8) - gentrified cafe with a nice outdoor arden seating, or at
  least it would be if it wasn't for the smokers, they serve shakshuka, which says it all about the gentrification.
  Breakfast finishes as 2pm and there isn't much protein on the menu.
  I went with the chicken sandwich as the highest protein option,
  which was surprisingly good in a toasted ciabatta style bread and the sauce really made it.
  It should be good it was more than £8 for the sandwich though. Gentrified. Wifi is a bit variable, 5/3 - 17/20 Mbit/s
- [San Ramon Caffee & Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Eves7pgDjbhATFYV8) - eggs royale was ok but a bit too much
  hollandaise sauce. 231/30 Mbit/s wifi
- [Street Food Karavan Budapest](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rVTwbMKuU6DupKq56) - interesting popular street food enclave
- [Restaurante Fuego](https://maps.app.goo.gl/suQotrwMGXpUvyfP7) - reasonably priced hungarian Goulash soup. Also does
  chicken/duck mains with sides you have to order separately. 84/31 Mbit/s wifi
- [Gerlóczy Kávéház](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ELCAiwmxf89uBR5S8) - indoor and outdoor seating in a quiet triangle
  crossroads. Quiet on a Saturday night while there is a 45 minute queue to get into Fat Mama.
  The daily special grilled chicken breast fillet with safe fried polenta, carrot cream, seasonal buttered vegetables
  and chicken liver croquette
  Stunning 806/137 Mbit/s wifi
- [Mischenko kitchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VQvbR9umL8WRMTzB7) - the goulash soup was decent, albeit a bit small,
  starter size rather than main size.
  The kompot house made "juice" from mix fruit and berries is basically coloured water with almost no flavour,
  don't bother with it next time. 98/20 Mbit/s wifi even sitting outside on the terrace,
  but unfortunately they close the terrace an hour earlier at 10pm

TODO:

- [Hungarikum Bisztró](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZB3oK5pfFW9MAofe9) - fully booked out for days :-/
- [Fat Mama](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hyN5NGZYXmbgmy4C7) - 45 minute queue for table on Sat evening, probably overrated
  due to being over commercialized, like Parasztkonyha below

Not recommended:

- [Parasztkonyha Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/28vif387fvTyTTtRA) - one of Hungary Top 20, with a queue to get in,
  but I felt the beef stew with grains was mediocre, especially for £15.
  I used to make much better more flavourful beef stew, theirs lacked wine and tomato reduction at the very least
- California Coffee Company - chain across Budapest with power chai lattes, go to independent places instead.
  29/28 Mbit/s wifi
- [Bulgarden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CeYAbrmUbYTG2ecU8) - the goulash soup was watery and the beef had massive amounts
  of fat, probably half of it, and it came with no bread. Ordering the bruschetta doubled the cost and it was mediocre.
  225/15 Mbit/s wifi

#### Debrecen

Eastern city I've used as a stopover driving between Romania and Budapest.

Some nice architecture. <!-- and hot young women -->

- [Csokonai Étterem](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5X7LCR9P35XR33zv9) -
  the chef's special orange duck leg with pink pepper-citrus mango puree was excellent, it comes with savoy potatoes.
  41/16 Mbit/s wifi, no password, but unfortunately the toilets have passwords <!-- 666666 -->

#### Gyor

Stopover town between Bratislava and Budapest.

A few nice architectural bits, you probably don't need more than 1 hour to walk around the centre.

- [Palffy Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z6RrsJUR8pT9R77y7) - prime tourist location with lots of outdoor seating
  in the town square.
  Popular, food is a bit mediocre for the price as expected, had the venison stew with dumplings for £15,
  expected the dumplings to be better
- [Győr, Petőfi híd Parking](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8WxsHv5hi7ts1iwp9) - free parking, a short walk from the centre

#### Szolnok

A modest town with a small centre to the east of the country.

A useful stopover point but there is not much to do there, don't spend more than a couple days there.

You will struggle to get fed once it hits 9pm as the kichens close much earlier than their, so make sure you dine earlier.

- [Bajnok Étterem](http://uj.bajnoketterem.hu/) - best place I ate at here
- [New York café & bistro](https://www.newyorkbistro.hu/)
- [OneBistro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fswF1W8nTAVzz9N97) - late night cheap eat open until 10pm
- [Guri Sörbisztró](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100040639554637) - best late night drinking spot open until midnight when everything else is dead. Try the pink
  tonic if you're non-alcoholic
- [Korzó Kávéház](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RarMxm48ziz5TxMX9) - another drinks only place open until midnight
- [TiszapArt Café](https://tiszamozi.hu/) - open until 11pm, with good lemonades

Not Recommended:

- [Evezős Csárda](http://www.evezoscsarda.hu/Etlap.cshtml) - despite its 4.5 rating on Google, I was not impressed with the food,
  either starter or main, and would give it a miss next time

#### Szeged

Southern border town, useful as a stopover between Hungary and Serbia.

- [Corso Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rfu2FgFp7neLBbdk9)
