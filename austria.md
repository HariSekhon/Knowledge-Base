_"There are no kangaroos in Austria"_ 😉

Apparently the origin of this phrase is because Americans get Austria confused with Australia.

You need to pay a motorway toll in Austria, similar to Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia.

### Parking in Vienna

Parking in Vienna is a nightmare, paid parking everywhere max 2 hours and parking garages are €50 a day.

Don't drive there.

### Restaurants in Vienna

A good destination for a long weekend. This capital feels sparse to a Londoner, but is very touristy in the center.

The taxi driver said young people leave because there isn't enough to do,
but it's good for a weekend city break with the girlfriend, especially if you like central european architecture,
and the Casino Wien restaurant:

- [Casino Wien](https://www.casinos.at/casinos/wien/casino-restaurant) is probably the best restaurant in Vienna. It is
  above the casino, which was surprisingly not fancy at all, smokey and low grade.
  But the restaurant above was a different story.
  Try the Chateaubriand for two with your girlfriend - only top restaurants do it
- [Le Burger](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5zWSvCF6LKPTu6ss5) - Austrian burger chain, mostly in Austria but with the odd
  venue in Dubai and Germany.
  The seasonal Berry Burger was great with balsamic blueberries and cottage cheese it in, giving it a hint of sweetness,
  and fries and sweet potato fries with cranberry ketchup dip.
  There are literally 12 different dips to help yourself with.
  The White City chicken burger was also good, with spicy jalapeños, iceberg lettuce, coleslaw salad, white cheese and
  white BBQ sauce. You can have it with grilled or crunchy (fried) chicken, the latter is recommended
- [Zanoni & Zanoni](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ttUtq2Uccg9R6sqG8) - popular dessert place open until midnight. The
  sachertorte (chocolate cake) was good. 14/1 Mbit/s open wifi with no details required connect capture portal
- [Gelateria Castelletto](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WnSS97cHEc8ToEn58) - the other best dessert place I know of, also
  open late, but a bit more upmarket and pricier than Zanoni & Zanoni though
- [Bouvier at The Hoxton](https://maps.app.goo.gl/StZ7vaoUmjNo8zW88) - hotel restaurant, relatively a bit expensive as
  one would expect.
  They don't do eggs benedict past breakfast 11:30am, so one must choose from the all day menu.
  It's €10 for avocado toast, and €2 for each poached egg on it.
  That's 4x the price per egg compared to Thailand's commercial areas.
  €14 with 2 poached eggs and you'll still be hungry from that single piece of sourdough toast
- [Figlmüller](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9oPDkoVA64AijSfj8) - upmarket viennese restaurant, known for its fried pork
  schnitzel but I had the viennese boiled beef in the pot with chive sauce, apple horseradish and browned potatoes
  (which come grated). You'll want to add the sliced pancake which comes in a small bowl for you to transfer the soup
  into. There were 3 veal steaks in the soup pot, which was very filling, but I liked the horseradish and potato the
  best as the veal once removed from the soup pot for the main lacks seasoning. The sachertorte / sacher cake is nearly
  half the price at Zanoni & Zanoni 2 minutes away, and bigger by the look of it. Go to Zanoni for dessert instead.
  I was actually asked by a homeless Romanian man for my food through the open window,
  so I put the scraps of my veal steaks into a napkin and passed it to him. Quite a bit of begging in Vienna
- [Apapika Bowls](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rUBKMo3WCJ3o3DvS7) - hawaiian poke bowls. Had the ginger truffle beef, but
  would go with the teriyaki salmon next. No wifi!
- [Choi Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pjdYjrvWowze4h9DA) - small coffee and sandwich shop. €4.70 for a chai latte! But
  it was decent, not too sweet. 104/25 Mbit/s wifi
- [Abbey Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bfYAVER9MHRirdXt7) - the tuna poke bowl was slow to arrive and although it
  didn't have much in it besides edamame and lettuce, the rice had a sweet and sometimes overpowering horshradish sauce.
  For poke bowls it's probably better to one of the specialist poke bowl places as you'll get more ingredients.
  Slow 1 Mbit/s wifi

Not Recommended:

- [Café Benedikt](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6GAo2E8e5qMHuFNx6) - overrated and over priced. Had ham and eggs, which was a
  single slice of ham with egg on it, they couldn't even get poached eggs correct after showing them on Google Translate
  and it seemed to be just egg white on a slice of ham, with the yellow missing for the vitamins. They're also cash
  only, and had several single old pensioners there, which was weird. I immediately went to Abbey Bar around the corner
  to eat again properly as the ham & eggs was inconsequential for €7.50.
  Their breakfast bundles seem even more overpriced at €16-20, without even muffins, the eggs come in a glass

## Graz

The second largest city in Austria, has some nice architecture in the centre.

### Parking in Graz

Parking is an absolute nightmare in Graz, like Vienna, everything is residence / paid parking.

I had to paid €18 for 24 hours parking here because the hostel had hardly any parking,
even 30 minutes walking distance outside the centre, and other places were even more expensive.

### Restaurants in Graz

- [Kylo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZpDsXPbgsjcLiLEV7) - gentrified brunch cafe / restaurant.
  The Vulcano Eggs were decent (Vulcano ham is also known as parma ham), and the eggs come fried by default but I asked
  them to come poached instead, had to ask for butter for the sourdough toast though
  (who has toast without butter on it!).
  I meant to tried the acai bowl here but spent too much time talking to a local couple...
