## Guatemala City

### Taxis in Guatemala City

Afternoon traffic was heavy, it took me nearly an hour in the taxi from La Aurora airport -
what should be a 20 minute drive according on Google Maps.

- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/gt/en/) - takes card
- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/en-gt) - cheaper and more cars but drivers only accept cash

There are some others like Yango but I haven't used them.

### Restaurants in Guatemala

- [Mr Taco](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zxM956HMyyuNMDYAA) - good and cheap - 3 tacos or 2 gringas for 30-35 GQT ($4.50).
  They have a good selection of toppings, from chilli sauces to onions to tiny pineapple cubes to finely chopped salad.
  This is a chain so you may be able to find others, this is the one I know is good.
  Their Jamaica water (sweet hibiscus drink) is good too.
