## Summary

Country in Central America just south of Mexico that uses the Guatemalan Quetzales currency.

## Immigration Declaration Required

You will need to complete a _"DJRV"_
Regional Traveller Affidavit which is basically just a customs declaration on the goods you are bringing in to the country -
your personal clothing, laptop etc and up to \$10,000 are exempt.

This will be emailed to you and must be presented to a customers officer after immigration control,
so there was a huge queue to get out of the baggage reclaim area after immigration control at Guamatala City's
La Aurora airport - they actually check this and may direct you to a full baggage scan like usually only done on
departure.

You can fill it in in advance at this website,
which will save you time having to do it at one of the kiosks upon arrival:

## Guatemala City

The capital - it's not very big, there isn't much in the way of attractions to see here -
the real novelty is the nature outside of the city, so most people don't spend more than a day or two here on stopover
to Antigua, Panajachel or Flores / Tikal National Park.

You'll probably want to stay someone between zone 1 and zone 4, which is walkable - about a half hour from zone 1.

Zone 9 is a bit further to the south, perhaps nearer an hour walk, but there is the nice
[Avenida La Reforma](https://maps.app.goo.gl/njgMsB2P7xq9nqZF9)
which has a central green corridor running north to south with monuments along it.

### Taxis in Guatemala City

Afternoon traffic was heavy, it took me nearly an hour in the taxi from La Aurora airport -
what should be a 20 minute drive according on Google Maps.

- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/gt/en/) - takes card
- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/en-gt) - cheaper and more cars but drivers only accept cash

There are some others like Yango but I haven't used them.

### ATMs in Guatemala City

I was charged 32 GTQ (\$4) for a withdrawal by Industrial Bank ATM in the centre.

Apparently some others are worse, asking for \$8 withdrawal fee.

### Attractions in Guatemala City

There are a handful of nice architectural buildings, but that's about it.

- [Palacio Nacional de la Cultura](https://maps.app.goo.gl/i8rLGatnaeKKXvac8)
- [Plaza de la Constitución](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VMEm6P432Cdd5NwQ9)
- [Iglesia San Francisco](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ybGFkQ8KJu4Z3ikY7)
- [Palace of the National Civil Police](https://maps.app.goo.gl/maSS8RxcSp3DcLMu8)

### Restaurants in Guatemala City

<!--

Tequila Sunrise hostel was surprisingly good, well equipped with free towels,
shower gel and the best breakfast 8-9am consisting of boiled eggs, pancakes, cereals and fruit.
The wifi was fairly reliable too

-->

- [Mr Taco](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zxM956HMyyuNMDYAA) - good and cheap - 3 tacos or 2 gringas for 35-40 GQT ($5).
  They have a good selection of toppings, from chilli sauces to onions to tiny pineapple cubes to finely chopped salad.
  This seems like a chain so you may be able to find others, this is the one I know is good.
  Their Jamaica water (sweet hibiscus drink) is good too.
  Even the street food in the centre was more expensive.
  This place was so good that I ate there every day I was in Guatemala City,
  and even ran out at 1am for one final hurrah before it closed at 2am.
  I recommend the asada (beef) tacos or gringas (40 GTQ) and then load them up with onions, pineapple, salad and
  drenched in lime for maximum flavour and filling - make use of the free toppings!
  Counterintuitively, the orange chilli sauce is more spicy than the red one,
  and the finely chopped salad topping is even more spicy than that due to the green chilli pieces in it.
  Has wifi
- [San Martín • Zona 4](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wiBAGmYMhBhssCxJ7) - probably the best coffee shop / restaurant / bakery
  in the area - full and buzzing with locals.
  This is a chain across the city, and it shows with how polished the menu and delivery is.
  If the other ones are this good, they are well worth a stop.
  This one is a bakery at the front and a large restaurant at the back.
  It has a surprisingly good menu selection of both food and drinks, reasonably priced.
  Drinks include lots of variations of coffees, juices and milkshakes with both ice cream and milk varieties,
  good burgers, pastas with chicken and shrimp and tequila reduction, pizzas and lighter _"pinsa"_ variations of pizzas,
  salads, soups, and very tempting selection desserts from the bakery.
  Get there 3-6pm for a cake and coffee for only 29 GTQ deal.
  The Centenaria burger was exquisite -
  a good quality thick burger with bacon, salad, and a sweet sauce of Ron Zacapa Centenario rum
  (this sauce must have lots of sugar in it to taste so good).
  If this isn't the best burger in Guatemala City I'd be surprised.
  This is what I wish Jack Daniels Texas burgers were in other places.
  The papas fritas is an extra 3 GTQ and are freshly baked thin crisp chips which I loved dipping into that sweet
  Ron Zacapa Centenario extra side sauce.
  This was totally worth the 75 GTQ.
  The vanilla milkshake (ice cream base) had just the right amount of sweetness, not too sweet as it first appeared
  when I saw it arrive with the rim of tiny candies glued with syrup and whipped cream on top - this was worth the
  36 GTQ.
  To top it all off, the pineapple strudel was only 8 GTQ (\$1), I just had to, and it was also good.
  Overall all of this was all completely worth the damage and I'd do it again.
  Forget your diet, be good tomorrow, when presented with these options, live for today's food.
  Wifi 83/81 Mbit/s

TODO:

- [Hwasanjung](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZdxA9yrQqoQnWYjk8) - Korean fine dining - 3, 5 or 8 course menus for
  150 / 250 / 395 GTQ (\$20 / \$33 / \$50) -
  expensive by local standards considering your can eat for 40-80 GTQ (\$5 - \$10) at places like Mr Taco

## Antigua

### Travel to Antigua

Antigua would normally be a 1-2 hour drive from Guatemala City.

However, I encountered heavy traffic between 10am-12pm so it took 3 hours, arriving just after 1pm.

The best option is to arrange a tourist shuttle from your accommodation for 100GQT (\$13).

You can go on an autobus for something in the region of 40GQT
(\$5) but this is apparently a hassle (and you'd have to take a taxi to the autobus collection point).

### Restaurants in Antigua

<!--

Adra hostel is even nicer than Tequila Sunrise with a central communical lounge area
that looks how you'd expect a luxury resort to look, shaded,
with lots of different seating and plants and exactly the type of music that is in my Upbeat & Sexual Pop spotify
playlist.
The wifi is a bit slow at 0.5/0.5 Mbit/s though

-->

## Panajachel

[Panajachel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wM1YiRVBLMvpyGZP7) is known Lake Atitlán and the San Pedro, Tolimán and Atitlán
volcanoes.

This is a 3-4 hour drive from Guatemala City.

### Travel to Panajachel

From Guatemala CIty or Antigua the options are similar to Antigua above,
arrange a tourist shuttle via your accommodation.

## Flores / Tikal National Park

[Tikal National Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FZRUpFZatLVnEqs76) is a jungle containing the ancient Mayan city of Tikal.
