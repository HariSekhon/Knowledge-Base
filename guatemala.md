## Summary

Country in Central America just south of Mexico that uses the Guatemalan Quetzales currency.

## Immigration Declaration Required

You will need to complete a _"DJRV"_
Regional Traveller Affidavit which is basically just a customs declaration on the goods you are bringing in to the country -
your personal clothing, laptop etc and up to \$10,000 are exempt.

This will be emailed to you and must be presented to a customers officer after immigration control,
so there was a huge queue to get out of the baggage reclaim area after immigration control at Guamatala City's
La Aurora airport - they actually check this and may direct you to a full baggage scan like usually only done on
departure.

You can fill it in in advance at this website,
which will save you time having to do it at one of the kiosks upon arrival:

## Guatemala City

The capital - it's not very big, there isn't much in the way of attractions to see here -
the real novelty is the nature outside of the city.

You'll probably want to stay someone between zone 1 and zone 4, which is walkable - about a half hour from zone 1.

Zone 9 is a bit further to the south, perhaps nearer an hour walk, but there is the nice
[Avenida La Reforma](https://maps.app.goo.gl/njgMsB2P7xq9nqZF9)
which has a central green corridor running north to south with monuments along it.

### Taxis in Guatemala City

Afternoon traffic was heavy, it took me nearly an hour in the taxi from La Aurora airport -
what should be a 20 minute drive according on Google Maps.

- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/gt/en/) - takes card
- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/en-gt) - cheaper and more cars but drivers only accept cash

There are some others like Yango but I haven't used them.

### ATMs in Guatemala City

I was charged 32 GTQ (\$4) for a withdrawal by Industrial Bank ATM in the centre.

Apparently some others are worse, asking for \$8 withdrawal fee.

### Attractions in Guatemala City

There are a handful of nice architectural buildings, but that's about it.

- [Palacio Nacional de la Cultura](https://maps.app.goo.gl/i8rLGatnaeKKXvac8)
- [Plaza de la Constitución](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VMEm6P432Cdd5NwQ9)
- [Iglesia San Francisco](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ybGFkQ8KJu4Z3ikY7)
- [Palace of the National Civil Police](https://maps.app.goo.gl/maSS8RxcSp3DcLMu8)

### Restaurants in Guatemala City

<!--

Tequila Sunrise hostel was surprisingly good, well equipped with free towels,
shower gel and the best breakfast 8-9am consisting of boiled eggs, pancakes, cereals and fruit

-->

- [San Martín • Zona 4](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wiBAGmYMhBhssCxJ7) - probably the best coffee shop / restaurant / bakery
  in the area - full and bizzing with locals It has a surprisingly good menu selection of both food and drinks,
  moderately priced.
  Drinks include lots of variations of coffees, juices and milkshakes with both ice cream and milk varieties,
  good burgers, pastas with chicken and shrimp and tequila reduction, pizzas and lighter _"pinsa"_ variations of pizzas,
  salads, soups, and very tempting selection desserts from the bakery.
  Get there 3-6pm for a cake and coffee for only 29 GTQ deal.
  Wifi 83/81 Mbit/s
- [Mr Taco](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zxM956HMyyuNMDYAA) - good and cheap - 3 tacos or 2 gringas for 35-40 GQT ($5).
  They have a good selection of toppings, from chilli sauces to onions to tiny pineapple cubes to finely chopped salad.
  This is a chain so you may be able to find others, this is the one I know is good.
  Their Jamaica water (sweet hibiscus drink) is good too.
  Even the street food in the centre was more expensive.

TODO:

- [Hwasanjung](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZdxA9yrQqoQnWYjk8) - Korean fine dining - 3, 5 or 8 course menus for
  150 / 250 / 395 GTQ (\$20 / \$33 / \$50) -
  expensive by local standards considering your can eat for 40-80 GTQ (\$5 - \$10) at places like Mr Taco

## Antigua

It's a 2 hour drive from Guatemala City.

You can go on an autobus for something in the region of 40GQT
($5) or arrange a shuttle from your accommodation for 100GQT ($13).
