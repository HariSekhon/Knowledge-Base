# Romania

Not cheap any more, almost Western prices.

## Taxis in Romania

- [Smarty](https://www.smarty-app.com/) - substantially cheaper than either Star Taxi or Bolt
- [Star Taxi](https://www.startaxi.com/) - apparently the most used Taxi app in Romania, but hassle to register with new
  app and then the Apple Pay card setup was decline, so I ended up using trusty old Bolt instead which I had used around
  SE Asia on Asian Winter Tour 2024-2025

## Motorway Tolls - e-Vignettes in Romania

If driving, you need to buy a vignette toll to use the motorways.

You can buy e-vignettes at a website like this:

[https://www.roviniete.ro](https://www.roviniete.ro/en/info/cumpara-rovinieta-electronica-online)

Otherwise you'll need to pull over at the first petrol station at the border and buy it there.

The vignette is by calendar day, so if you're driving late at 11pm+ and arriving after midnight you'll need 2 days toll
cover.

It's €2.50 for a 1 day pass or €5.30 for 30 day vignette pass -
so it's a no brainer to just get the 30 days to cover your entry and exit. You'll need your car registration certificate
(from the UK this is the red V5C) and chassis serial number, which is on the certificate.

If crossing into Romania from Bulgaria across [The Bridge of Friendship](https://maps.app.goo.gl/r4ifvsuaRKKF37AJ6),
the bridge toll is €4 and can be paid by card at the bridge entry. Apparently no money, no ~~honey~~ friendship!

## Bucharest

You only need 2-3 days in Bucharest, I made the mistake of booking a week.

Restaurant availability on a Saturday night is very poor, similar to Edinburgh, you may want to reserve a table.

- [Reina Brasserie](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HFkz2ocUxQNVSjDq6) - excellent menu and reasonable prices, good ambience,
  good drinks menu from wine & cocktails to beers, milkshakes and coffees. Good service, plenty of seating, more seating
  downstairs, and all day breakfast available too.
  The beef schnitzel portion size is substantial and comes pre-cut, while the patatas bravas are excellent, crispy and
  light, and all covered in large square parmesan shavings. Excellent food quality. Fast 241/263 Mbit/s wifi
- [Chocoloco Bistro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KcHNXk7c8zhtzp7j9) - as naughty as it sounds.
  Upmarket coffee & hot chocolate shop with a wide variety of desserts, especially chocolate and pistachio based ones,
  cakes, crepes, waffles, pancakes, milkshakes, and even a brunch menu with eggs and salmon until 3:30pm
  (the bistro part). The pistachio milkshake it good, a little sweet with cream on top
  - [Chocoloco Old Town](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9B6ZeLwoLXLKZJDe9) - chain of two
- [Restaurant TOKA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vWTSiBiqmyrMNLQa8) - upmarket restaurant but away from the centre so you'll
  get better food.
  The creamy chicken and walnut soup was amazing,
  the best in its class I've had in years, flavourful and bigger than expected, with high quality cubes of chicken,
  plus comes with 4 slices of seeded toasts. Add the provided lemon for an extra zing - they also served chilli flakes,
  olive oil and balsamic vinegar platter. I'd return just for this soup alone.
  The rabbit with rice is good too, and comes with large chunks of meat, but watch out for all the small bones.
  Wifi is slow at only 7/1 Mbit/s and only works in the rear section of the restaurant
- [Mom](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TfS4yye1AgkJbtqv6) - the mom burger is very good, with a big juicy patty and covered in
  a really great sauce, and comes with well seasoned crispy fries. 16/103 Mbit/s wifi
- [Sip Coffee & Wine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FYcWDgsnejtGEjRn6) - gentrified coffee shop with downstairs wine bar, with
  some trendy cushions on the window ledge as seats facing the road outside. Typical western prices, £3 for a coffee and
  £3 for a slice of cake. The hojicha (Japanese green tea) latte and vegan cherry chocolate cake were both good.
  54/89 Mbit/s wifi
- [Bogdania Bistro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pr2HNbwvkfkZSvas7) - very nice bistro with reasonable prices by
  international standards. The sea bass with black lentils was good, it comes with lemon and artisan salt flakes.
  The mixed side salad is a good accompaniment. 96/48 Mbit/s wifi even sitting outside
- [French Bakery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/puKvwPqPZmfzJLUM8) - small coffee and dessert shop on the main road. The fruit
  tart is very good, the latte is decent (I'm not a coffee connoisseur to really judge this). 36/37 Mbit/s wifi,
  although it needed a router reboot to start working properly
- [Artichoke Social House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Gm4XXdSZiVZrS4nF9) - coffee / cocktails, dark outdoor seating with
  small candles, good young person's date place, but people are sitting in coats even in May, almost no indoor seating,
  which is basically an alcove by the toilet.
  The pre-pressed orange turmeric juice is very good, albeit small at 200ml for £3.20.
  Trendy places 🙄. They don't do the hot milk drink you see on the online menu unless its winter, not even in May when
  its cold. 104/3 Mbit/s wifi, but not really a digital nomad working place unless it's summer, given there is
  almost zero indoor seating and a "no laptops" policy after 6pm or at weekends!
- [Ruby Coffee Nuts & Chocolate](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZSx4uSuzbnRp3Bp99) - the Ruby Ginger Juice with ginger, fresh
  orange juice, lemon and honey was good, although came in a martini class so a bit small.
  The Happy smoothie was very good too, but also small, it came in what looks like a small jam jar.
  The venue has a selection of chocolates, nuts, jams and gift hampers.
  This is the sort of place one accommodates one's girlfriend.
  Good selection of teas, coffees, juices, smoothies, alcohols, beers, wines and cocktails. 26/29 Mbit/s wifi
- [Uzina Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nK99id1Vqw2Rw2uu8) - nice prana chai latte with whole star anise.
  104/103 Mbit/s wifi
- [Waterloo Taverne](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CbyTrUR6qr7Vrt5AA) - probably the best Belgian restaurant in Bucharest,
  classy with piano music.
  The candied duck leg with mashed potatoes and truffles is good,
  but not too filling so if you don't have a starter you'll have space for dessert.
  They of course have a big selection of Moules Frites (chips and mussels),
  steaks, chicken, starters and a selection of Belgian beers.
  68/11 Mbit/s wifi, but signal is too poor to work at the front of the restaurant,
  so sit in the middle or back of the restaurant if you need wifi
- [Excalibur](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TBTnH6CXjqwG5YTi8) - medievil themed restaurant with excellent menu, popular for
  groups and dates. Has various beef, pork and chicken dishes and platters for groups. Internationally priced.
  The beef goulash in bread bowl is unfortunately mediocre at best compared to many other places across Europe,
  and comes too dry. Try one of the other dishes next time, they sound better.
  Closes at 12, but kitchen closes at 11pm, but they may not serve soups at last order time.
  The lemonade is exactly as you'd make it at home. 6/3 Mbit open wifi 'lancelot'
- [Coffee Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ieZMPGMnYUjTo8Xv6) - coffees, spiced chai latte, pastries. Also serves a
  range of alcoholic drinks as many do in this area
- [Cismigiu Gardens](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2DyWEWiJJLfmkrB56) - popular managed gardens park, romantic walks with many
  couples, boat rides, cafes and a large play area of climbing activities and slides for kids
- [Izvor Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7GRnzRYaZG3HBU1s6) - good flat grassy park for dogs

TODO:

- [Hygge - Social Kitchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vjGH1FJfUzxDopYs7) - reasonably priced burgers, but their kitchen
  closes at 9:30pm
- [AveForchetta](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dn5AD1Mdz78KB5e88) - very busy, no seats at 7:30pm on a Saturday
- [La Romana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yFnFQQWYTUerj6hx6) - popular ice cream shop open until 11am
- [Velocità](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1oEzjdzS1SUigf1ZA) - another popular ice cream & coffee shop busy until late 11pm
- [Coftale Specialty Coffee Shop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mpHNJQBb2QDwxbWY8)
- [DeSoi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AS5U2nniUEnq5nBa8) - bistro with nice interior, looks like a semi coffee restaurant
- [buoni e bravi - Piața Sfântul Ștefan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7LeZjQp3j4Zd51eq6) - well rated restaurant
- [Simbio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nRh9QZyXoVWa95WC6) - affordable foodie restaurant
- [Noa Restoclub](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tJ2LD1Me1j8XrBaWA) - steak restaurant
- [Arto](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pBEaGx8uk1gS9q7f9) - fancy restaurant

Not recommended:

- [Papila](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Yt2pedUuWkHRJ55E7) - expensive, small and busy, no seats at 6:30pm on a Saturday.
  The dinner set combination menu is relatively expensive compared to other Bucharest restaurants.
  The lunch menu from 12-17:00 is a bit cheaper, but I still spent £27 for 2 courses and a Kimchi side, without even
  a drink. On the lunch menu the noodle soup starter with minced meat was almost the size of a main dish,
  but not worth it in flavour or at nearly £9. Skip it or pick one of the other soups for half the price next time.
  The chicken thigh with lemon syrup sauce was sold out so I tried the beer battered seabass burger, which comes with
  pickles but no fries. It was ok. The spicy kimchi side was a bit too much at a whole bowl full, as kimchi is usually
  served in a mini dish no bigger than your palm, and it cost £4-5. The Papila network wifi has no password, just a
  capture terms. At 17:50, with the restaurant nearly entirely empty at the end of the lunch period, sitting stuffed
  from having over ordered, but disappointed in flavours, and 1 minute after I settled the bill with a tip... within
  30 seconds of opening my laptop to ironically write this restaurant review, the waitress immediately informed me that
  I can't use my laptop because of a strict no laptop policy. I looked around the empty restaurant, then back at her,
  it wasn't like they needed the space, packed up and left for Ruby's above to write this review.
  I didn't even get a minute to run a wifi speed test.
  Lack of customer service and common sense. I'd skip Papila next time, I've seen what they've got,
  the food was nothing special and the service was better at other restaurants too.
  Overall a disappointing restaurant.
- [Subura Bistro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP2tUW0HDHA) - Italian with a good range of pizzas and pastas.
  Well rated by the tagliatelle bolognese was too mediocre, I wouldn't order this again, I left half of it, not worth
  it. Perhaps the pizzas are better. 6/18 Mbit/s wifi
- [Gyros Thessalonikis](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hWBebuEHi4ikz9oC8) - Greek souvlaki. If you have to eat late night and
  the other places kitchens are closed. I got food poisoning there though, so better to plan and eat earlier at other
  places

## Brașov

Stopped over here between Bucharest and Cluj-Napoca.

It turns out this is nicer than Bucharest and is a historic town.

I should have stayed here. Next time.

- [Sergiana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hvmRHMq8SmGBJVbTA) - local transylvanian chain, bigger than I imagined.
  Wild boar medallion in hazelnut crust with mushroom,
  caramelized cranberry sauce and mashed potatoes was amazing in both flavour, textual and presentation.
  Don't waste your appetite on the free bread and pork crackling, it's worth the wait.
  The caramelized cranberries at the sides are very sweet and good when mixed in to the mash,
  but you should probably leave some of them at the side unless you have an extremely sweet tooth.
  The Papanasi romanian sweet cheese dumplings with sour cream and jam were ok, they're like 2 dough balls with filling
  but quite fattening and a step too far after such a great main. I'd skip it next time.
  The blueberry juice is natural mixed with grape juice and very sweet, 14.5% sugar!
  Worth it to sip on if you have a sweet tooth like me.

## Cluj-Napoca

University town. The Old Town centre is nice but only about a 4 block square so you only need a couple hours for it,
but much more for all the gentrified coffee shops and restaurants.

There are huge gated houses with expensive cars like Porsche, Mercedes and BMW SUVs just north of the Old Town, which
explains why some of the restaurants in the Old Town are pricey. It is very common to see Mercedes, BMW and Audis around
Old Town.

- [Mozart Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ksPUrUC6Jjh7zf1M8) - an experience place on the outer rim of the Old Town,
  centre with amazing decor, classical music playing and the best menu of teas and coffees I've ever seen,
  as well as rich cakes, waffles and ice cream sundaes.
  Wifi has no password but a jaw dropping 614/545 Mbit/s speed tested
- [Form Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wKqZEHMb3WyXS4UQ9) - trendy buzzing late night bar restaurant cafe with hip-hop
  playlist and a good menu range and prices
- [Arta Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cCuXbZ3ybwjtQjUa7) - the masala chai latte was so good I went back for it again
  all 3 days I was here. It comes with a whole cinnamon twig and dried orange slice on it, which I like to eat. Closes
  at midnight on Fri-Sat but only 10pm on Sun - Thurs.
  Wifi speeds have ranged widely eg, 2, 15, 28, 31 Mbit/s download and 12-22 Mbit/s upload at different times and nights
- [Eggcetera](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a4kDMSjMMcMsmW6N6) - gentrified coffee shop (pricey) with good menu egg breakfast
  menu. Unfortunately, "No laptop" policy on the big long bench table, which is pretty much the entire seating of the
  restaurant. No laptop policy was announced within 30 seconds of pull out laptop. There are 3 small tables stool tables
  on which a laptop can be used apparently but of course all were occupied by diners.
  The eggs royale with smoked salmon was excellent, but then it should be for £9, with excellent use of salt flakes to
  create contrast with the soft sweet half buns under the salmon and cream cheese. My top pick breakfast place here.
  191/49 Mbit/s wifi
- [Garlic - bites&tales](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kLoXsBSXH58Q3vod9) - popular restaurant with a good menu, substantial
  garlic options. I had the pork tenderloin in gorgonzola sauce with sweet potato fries (I had them swapped for oven
  baked potatoes with garlic), which was good and hit the spot with a good portion size of meat and carbs.
  242/233 Mbit/s wifi
- [Insomnia Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QzFbAGNB96uyqr1t5) - open until 2am,
  good range of both alcoholic and caffeinated drinks, and even milk with honey and cinnamon for those wanting a night
  cap without caffeine.
  41/9 Mbit/s wifi
- [Sage Bistro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/35VEWQDeG1nrX1856) - a slightly less busy bar-restaurant on a side street with
  a reasonable menu and prices.
  The grilled bone-in pork chop with truffle mashed potatoes looks amazing,
  but I went with the homemade burger as I needed the bigger more food (the weight in grams in listed).
  The fries were over-done.
  Next time get the pork chop special.
  The mixed greens salad comes undressed but olive oil and balsamic is provided, so it turns out well.
  Jaw dropping 481/248 Mbit/s wifi

## Oradea

Nice architecture town.

Stopped over 1 night between Cluj-Napoch and Debrecen on the way to Budapest.
You only need 1 hour to walk around the centre.

- [Meron - Specialty Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/trGnyoFCGPLQqmTe9) - chain coffee shop on the main parade.
  The eggs royale (poached eggs with smoked salmon) was very good in both presentation and flavours,
  and even has pear pieces around it. The smoked salmon is salty though so you'll need the table water.
  94/85 Mbit/s wifi, no password
- [Merci Bistro & Coffee Oradea](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RzrfYzrJb3n4TjoS7) - duck leg with mashed potatos, assorted
  side salad. 430/281 Mbit/s wifi
