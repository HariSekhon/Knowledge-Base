# Latvia

The sour cabbage soup in a bread bowl is the local speciality.

See the Travel page's [Do Not Speed](../travel.md#do-not-speed) section.

## Riga

Riga, the capital, is nice for a visit for perhaps 2 days.

You will run out of things to do.

- [Rozengrāls](https://rozengrals.lv/en/#nav) - Medieval restaurant with good menu and ambience. They do a suckling piglet spit roast only on
  Fridays and Saturdays
- [St. Peter's Church](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SJMk9s1zr36SYNPL8) - check out the view from St Peter's Church, they will
  charge €9 for entry to the tower though. Capitalism applies even to the church it seems
- [Dzintari Forest Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xLusynMkirWyvyUm7) - managed forest with a high tower for view
- [Dzintari Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/h8uuFn2PGAtiSzmd8) - surprisingly nice beach in the summer
