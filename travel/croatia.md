Croatia is expensive and service is often not good.

There are a lot of better countries to visit.

Some restaurants even refuse to split group bills, and I didn't find anywhere that serves breakfast past 12-1pm.

It's also too hot in Summer, if you're going to do it, do it in Spring or Autumn instead.

## Zagreb

The capital - small and not a lot to do, don't waste more than 2 days here.

One English guy from Essex I met in Ljubljana, Slovenia,
just before I went to Zagreb said, _"What are you going to do in Zagreb for 5 nights?!"_.

_"Eat all their restaurants food"_, I replied. Yeah, he was right, don't spend more than 2 days here.

The [Museum of Broken Relationships](https://maps.app.goo.gl/s8EohssTuM1knTQr7) is worth a visit here, with artifacts
donated from around the world is sometimes heartbreaking real life stories.

- [Stari Fijaker](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ug2upBMmqsTi9W9f7) - good Croatian restaurant, locals eat here too, moderately
  priced depending on what you have.
  The "Peasant's Lunch" plate was really good with a great mix of tasty food on it, and affordable.
  The Venison strew with gnocci had good deer meat pieces in sauce, but is a bit pricier.
  The apple strudel was average, could skip that next time
- [Submarine Burger Bogovićeva](https://maps.app.goo.gl/peaWm4BhKti6ybsC8) /
  [Submarine Burger Frankopanska](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7r5ah4qTbDRvFUBWA) - all-natural homemade gourmet burger
  chain.
  The Bogovićeva location was very lively with nearly all the tables full on a Wednesday night, and the burgers were
  very good.
  The original burger was good, the smokehouse burger was even better,
  and the salchipapas fries were very good with bbq mayo and many pieces of smoked sausage quarter slices made from
  black Slavonian pig and came in a portion easily big enough for 2 people to share
- [Curry Bowl](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RBtVDPfb6kAu16WB9) - great menu, flavours and reasonable prices.
  I had the butter squid which wasn't on the online menu but was really good and filling.
  I can skip the pol-sambol side next time as it doesn't add much, but the bread side was good, similar to garlic bread.
  We had a 10% discount leaflet from the hostel reception but one of our guys forgot to give it to the waiter! 🙈
- [Broom44](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7ZUkcKZghxAnKmy77) - cafe overlooking the central fruit market, the fresh squeezed
  orange juice was a tad small (typical in Europe), but the avocado toast with sunny side up eggs was really good, with
  a bit of onion and seasoning in the avocado spread and the toast was a thick sourdough which appeared to make it too
  bready but was just right actually
- [Pivnica Mali Medo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a2AZkxeG8yPjzPK2A) - popular beer hall with lots of outdoor seating
  serving a sizeable selection of pizzas, beef goulash, burgers and some chicken/pork mains.
  The beef goulash with gnocchi came with a lot of meat for €15,
  but don't wait to eat it as it didn't come piping hot (also, eating it outdoors cool summer evening).
  Wifi didn't work
  - [Pivnica Medvedgrad Ilica](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QV49uj1qUosSFPDA6) - another one of this chain - burgers
    ingredients sound good and reasonably priced, and the mains sound good too.
    Slightly different menu at each site, doesn't have the goulash with gnocchi
- [Oakberry](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SjfD59FFKJxJanfs5) - international Acai chain
- [Dolac Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3DXxcMZ3boK3x5669)
- [Monument To King Tomislav](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Cv6GmBqmk3w474n89)

Brunch Problems: I walked around for 4 hours trying to find somewhere that would serve me breakfast / brunch in the
afternoon, without success.

Like in Slovenia, the culture is to stop breakfast menus at 12pm. In the end I went to the
[SPAR supermarket on Žerjavićeva](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vwPYcqi1oMJAaN546), bought my own eggs and made myself
scrambled eggs.

## Split

Much better and more touristy than Zagreb.

Diocletian's Palace and the surrounding architecture and roman ruins give a real flavour of history.

Zadar seems to have more couples while Split seems to have more western early twenties people looking to party.
Watch out for those entrance fees (€10-30).
I can see why the veteran expat hostel owner at Zadar didn't like Split, but many people may prefer it.

- [Fig Split](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RVFnsbsNi1PZcBMH9) - excellent restaurant, had a queue. Doesn’t take reservations,
  expect to wait 20-30 mins for an outside table, less if accepting an inside table. Menu is good but not cheap, €20 for
  a blueberry-japaleno burger, €4.50 for a bottled juice. Has cocktails
- [Submarine Burger - Centar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZGjdvLug1fuHssns8) - same chain as above in Zagreb.
  Reasonable prices compared to some tourist trap restaurants, around €12 a burger and €4 for a drink, Tried the
  Italian burger this time, the Mmokehouse burger is still the best one IMO
- [Gelateria aMare](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pDiV4Adhx2FxGrmg6)
  ([second location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f1rnNyuYA99umSLd7)) - excellent gelateria, amazing selection €2.80 per
  scoop.
  The pistacchio was exactly at the gelato standard as you'd expect,
  although smooth with nuts, and the coconut similarly good
- [Good Food](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZdziYK7tdTe52drL6) - this is actually a better poke-style salad restaurant than
  burger restaurant, cheaper than Lola below, nearly half the price for a salad, so I stopped here when I saw it first
- [Diocletian's Palace](https://maps.app.goo.gl/675iBnbnepQPYEwt9) - yes that Diocletion - the Roman emperor - classic
  Roman architectural buildings and some ruins
- [West Bank](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TSCrmUtQXuVzaYwf8) - good place to watch the sunset and superyachts, has benches
- [Forest Park Marjan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4D3wq5eaPWusmp6BA)
- [Plaža Ježinac Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uZdzVqnRXHkeov7T8)
- [Kasjuni Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dWNNm1ApkRKxhhEWA) - this is a 45 minute walk out of central Split,
  many people were taking taxis in and out
- [Bacvice Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1vD3NQXTs7KMwqRD8) - small beach with a shallow shore, closer to the centre
  than Kasjuni beach

TODO:

- [Kat's Kitchen Brunch Club](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rSJ8KMFCdRakAH8dA) - recommended by veteran expat in Zadar, and
  highly rated on Google
- [Picasso Pizza & Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/c8wJuPa2kGaBzhBw6) - great decor and ambience, reasonable pizza prices
- [Lola Split](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q2ib1A7ayjDo4bXt9) - medium priced restaurant with an Octopus salad for €18-20
- [Caffe bar La Linea](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jy6H4VHMEJbcMeJe8)
- [Froggyland](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Q1MitBQ13EKxvde9) - museum of stuffed frogs simulating real-life human scenarios

Not recommended:

- [Oakberry Acai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4XfidfNy6xv1FeU58) / [port stall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HX3K6LLqBTRkyiGx6) -
  badly overpriced at €13 for a medium acai cup and most fruits are €1 extra.
  Was much better and cheaper in Bali.
  Also, way too many seeds and nuts drowned out the Açai itself,
  it was a struggle crunching way through so many seeds with a little acai around it -
  perhaps this is a strategy because seeds are cheaper than Acai?
  Go for a gelato instead, cheaper and nicer and there are many great places for it here like Gelato aMere above

## Zadar

Small streets remind me of Venice.

Zadar seems to have more couples and families.

- [Restoran Bruschetta](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LkkubpbLcg7T9DNM6) - upmarket italian restaurant. Pork medallions with
  gnocchi was good, but the Pistachio Cheesecake was even better
- [Konoba Tovar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iXWYGt11QBdmR6hQ8) - seafood restaurant on a side street. The mixed fried
  seafood was good, a very large prawn, whole squids and lots of small fried whitebait. Cash only
- [Colonna bar & caffe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gA5iEKAAhSUJonoR7) - upmarket cocktail bar, €14-15 per fancy cocktail,
  which is double the price of another place in Zadar
- [Lazy Monkey Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4AuAhfD1WWdBJiw76) - a bar and free pool table, most people don't go out!
- [Sea Organ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uWVaBETiy5dxipS58) - the best place to watch the sunset and take pics

Not recommended:

- [Coffee & Cake - Kavana Centar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TGVsFniVxznAizucA) - Brazilian friend said their Acai is fake,
  just frozen fruit

## Dubrovnik

Overrated and expensive. Even hostels here are more expensive than hotels in other countries.

Unless you're a yacht bro, or desperately want to see the steps from Game of Thrones,
this should be low down the list in terms of quality and value for money.

Not worth it at all in my opinion.

The Dubrovnik Riviera views on the drive down there from Split along the winding mountain roads
were a dangerous, but spectacular James Bond drive.

Restaurants here are quite expensive, with mains often in the €30 range.
By the time you order a couple drinks and add the pressured tip, you're looking at €50 per head.

Not Recommended:

- [Barba](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DALFKJv6Kn4QB4gN6) - the octopus burger that lures people in is reconstituted patty
  with fried breadcrumbs, not the real octopus tentacle you might imagine.
  The shrimp burger is similarly reconstituted and even more expensive, also not worth it in my opinion.
  The fries and onion rings in the meal version are good though, but without good quality burgers it's pointless
