## Summary

A lot of fellow travellers have raved to me about Peru.

A lot of westerners go there for the famous Machu Picchu site.

I was surprised how good the food was,
and moderately priced by international standards (expect to pay \$25-30 for a decent steak meal as of Jan 2026).

It turns out that Peru is quite the foodie destination.

The currency is the Peruvian Sol which is roughly 3.3 per \$1 or 4.5 per £1 as of Jan 2026.

I used Saily e-sim in Bolivia as it was the cheapest I could find at the time,
but be sure to check all the [Mobile e-Sim providers](../travel.md#mobile-e-sims)
I list in the travel overview page as prices can change.
I purchased the 3GB for 30 days package, but that was actually more than I needed even for 10 days.
I used less than 1GB by the time I was leaving and basically used the rest waiting at the airport in Cusco.

## ATMs in Peru

- [Banco de la Nación](https://www.bn.com.pe/) - these ATMs have no withdrawal fees as of Jan 2026, so always look for these
  for the odd restaurant or street vendor who doesn't take card,
  and also to be able to take InDrive taxis at half the price of Uber.

## Lima

The capital, I recommend at least 2-3 days to make use of the good restaurants and street gyms.
There are also activities like surfing lessons.

I have never seen so many free calisthenic bar gyms in a city (mainly along the coast)
and even a free open air gym with heavy bags and an MMA cage, which I have never seen anything else.

Between the good affordable steaks food and free workout areas, this has got to be one of the cheapest cities in the
world in which to stay in shape.

### Lima Airport

There is a reasonable selection of food places past security.

Wifi is free and actually pretty fast at 67/79 Mbit/s, and the capture portal is not too demanding
requiring first name, last name and email address.

### Transport to/from Lima Airport

You can take the official Airport Express bus from opposite the Arrivals door 3 -
the booth is across the road and they take card payments.

It's only 20 Peruvian Sol (\$6) as of Jan 2026, but it only leaves once an hour.
The journey takes about 45 minutes once moving.

There is air conditioning and wifi on board - 44/31 Mbit/s.. although I didn't see any plugs or USB charging ports.

Due to the long wait I did try to get a QuickLlama bus which goes more frequently but apparently you need to reserve
them in advance and I couldn't find their stall.

On the way back I took an InDrive (taxi app) for 30 Sol cash, half the price of an Uber.
The journey time is around 35 minutes in the car.

### Best Areas to Stay in Lima

<!--

[Pariwana hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sHzLrj5mUrU8qQWB8) was great, lots of social activities,
and kitchen but you have to ask the bar for a pan, they don't keep them in there.
It's also very central to Parque Kennedy.
The downside is they have no water cooler, they charge for bottled water, and
the Friday night BBQ with live DJ is so loud you can hear it all the way downstairs in the room at 22:30pm

-->

- [Miraflores](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QBzFkX21w2ACk4NTA) - tourist area, close to the ocean and parks
  - [Parque Kennedy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dznhsVv1AfuFK1uM8) - central, lively area with lots of cafes & restaurants
  - [Malecón de Miraflores](https://maps.app.goo.gl/19bYcAJ347rzuUU79) - cliff side ocean views, quieter
- [Barranco](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JhNDhgGmrBHFDECMA) - considered trendier & more artsy, has bars & nightlife

### Attractions in Lima

- [Parque Kennedy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/D73Fcwy2tj2voexh6) - triangle shaped park with cafes and restaurants along
- it. This is the central tourist area
- [Malecón de Miraflores](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7kfZDBm8aCBxsETc9) - beach cliff parade with lots of free calesthetic
  bar gyms along it
- [Parque de la Juventud](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3yvHhvx64wEAbLmu5) - _"youth park"_ - free gym area - amazing -
  has 4 heavy bags, a small MMA cage, tonnes of calesthetic bars and even Olympic rings.
  I have never seen a free street gym so well equipped,
  and there are police / security inside and outside so it's ultra safe.
  There are even public toilets there
- [Barranco](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K46a54PvuQk1eUBm9) - artsy and bar area

### Restaurants in Lima

TODO: explore Barranco restaurants

- [La Lucha Sangucheria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ux1jm5WpqqQVPZPT7) /
  [La Lucha Sangucheria Criolla](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9D2r9Zq4tS4cTXTW8) -
  very popular & reasonably cheap Peruvian not-so-fast food place with burgers/sandwiches, fries and milkshakes.
  The Lomo Lucha tenderloin burger is very basic but real beef slices, albeit salty.
  The fries look amazing and crispy, wish I’d tried them too.
  The milkshakes are a bit small for 13 Sol though - it comes in a regular typical
  coffee cup and I’m not sold on the native Peruvian Lucuma fruit flavour.
  Not sure there is wifi
- [Mercado San Martín](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Pi5kFnpKHxHuniHg8) - contains various street food stalls

## Cusco & Sacred Valley

5 days recommended:

- Cusco City - 2-3 days - historic center (near Plaza de Armas)
- Sacred Valley - 2 days
  - Aguas Calientes (town at base of Machu Picchu) or Ollantaytambo or Urubamba
  - Machu Picchu - 1 day

## Cusco

Was the capital of the Inca Empire.

A good base point for pilgrimages to the Sacred Valley & Machu Picchu.

One of the greatest foodie cities I've ever seen by a mile -
I wouldn't bother eating anywhere under a 4.8 here as the competition is so high.
The restaurants here wipe the floor with the ones in Lima or Aguas Calientes (Machu Picchu town).

It's a shame the altitude and weather can be uncomfortable, but one can't have everything.

### Best Areas to Stay in Cusco

- [Historic Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oJijyxVCXb1JxSR28) near
  [Plaza de Armas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9QotCwX2Sd993EDz6) -
  busy, central, restaurants, shops & markets
  - tours departure from here for Machu Picchu & Sacred Valley
- [San Blas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vxReGBENU3TG6ZjY7) - quieter, more bohemian / artsy, cafes, but still close enough
  to the centre

<!--

[Pariwana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mmXXWdJvdJeNgPJQ9) is really nice, has a good bar with a free pool table,
and is walking distance as Cusco is fairly small anyway. Kitchen is a bit limited though.
Wifi 87/93 Mbit/s but it only works intermittently despite full signal bars.
This is very frustrating and why I didn't stay here again

[Blacky Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zTnfWakBHJyVtKJX6) - cheap at only £6 per night, has a full kitchen.
Wifi 52/36 Mbit/s

-->

### ATMs in Cusco

- [Cajero Banco de la Nación](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NELFyQMG5rDeGuqLA) - free cash withdrawals. You will need cash
  for entrance tickets to historic sites like the Sacred Valley, as well as cheaper InDrive taxis and avoiding card
  charges with cheaper accommodation or tour operators (I used Marina's in the main square as it was far cheaper than
  what the tour operator embedded in my accommodation would charge).

### Restaurants in Cusco

- [Kusykay Peruvian Craft Food](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cVkEDscgi7ZkYnZH7) - excellent restaurant - fine dining at
  only moderate price.
  The Andean soup starter was by far the best I had in Peru, fine dining with chicken, noodles,
  and 5 green sauce dots around the plate.
  The Lomo de Alpaca was also very good, with a bed of quinoa, crispy wafers, and double layered artistic sauce drizzles
  ending in dollops with green dips on them.
  I should have tried dessert here in hindsight as the food was top notch.
  WiFi 138/152 Mbit/s
- [Moray](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yRuM9YQm32H3RrPu7) - the food was amazing, this place deserves its 4.9 rating.
  The alpaca tenderloin with goldenberry sauce on it, potato millefeuille (triple layer potato square) and vegetables
  was excellent.
  The only thing I wish is that the portion size was bigger, the plate came with drizzle around the sides.
  The 3 liquid truffle balls in batter with huacatay (peruvian mint) ice cream was also good,
  and also I could have eaten way more of it.
  Wifi 271/381 Mbit/s
- [Ofrenda Peruvian Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8TJFF1BLXfhVUrq39) - great menu, good decor & reasonable prices.
  The quinoa chicken soup was not as good as Kushkay's though, so I'd skip that next time.
  The guinea pig was fine dining, but the quarters had little meat, mostly mash base & fancy vegetables.
  I would go with the alpaca next time.
  The _"Despertar De La Luna"_ drink of blueberry, coconut cream and hierba buena (mixed herbs) was surprisingly good.
  I was going to haggle over whether this deserved its 4.9 star rating until I tried their dessert.
  The _"Give Me Chocolate"_ dessert was amazing - hot chocolate sponge (not cream as written) coated with pisco and
  set on fire in front of me, with purple ice cream, fresh fruits, 2 different coulis (one yellow, one red), and
  crumble - this is everything I could ever hope for in a dessert.
  I was eating this with a rapid spooning frequency that must have made me look like a starving person who hadn't just
  had 2 prior courses.
  The waitress also gave me two samples of the cheesecake which was very good too,
  but if you like chocolate, go with the _"Give Me Chocolate"_.
  I hope they never change or discontinue this dessert.
  It was the best dessert I'd had in ages.
  I blew the budget at $40 here though, next time skip the soup, that wasn't worth the cost - get it at KusyKay instead
  if you're in the mood for soup as it's the same price but much better there.
  WiFi 69/70 Mbit/s
- [Qampaq Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yPhwECuPP1FX3gzL8) - excellent Alpaca skewers with crispy potatoes, but
  a difficult walk uphill at low altitude.
  Nice view from the upper level though.
  Has wifi
- [Yaku Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qtJYgN51wbVAvX3h8) - the lomo saltado alpaca was very good quality, and the
  chocolate brownie dessert was stuffing as it was 3 mid-sized brownie wedges with a small house made fruit ice cream
  in the middle - 2 people who aren't greedy could share this one.
  The venue itself is half open air and half outdoor shelter so not so warm depending on the weather.
  Wifi 168/437 Mbit/s
- [Oculto](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rfkJRVrAv5KZYYr4A) - prices look reasonable, until you find out they’re tapas and not
  mains like the other restaurants in Cusco, so you are advised to order 2-3 dishes per person.
  The plates near the top of the menu are smaller and the ones near the bottom are bigger.
  Two of the bigger dishes,
  the _"lomo fino de alpaca"_ (alpaca tenderloin steak strips with french fries) and _"pulpo a la parilla"_
  (grilled octopus) with potatoes were enough food for me.
  The alpaca sliced tenderloin meat was excellent and tender, and the octopus had good thick tentacles too.
  The mousse de chocolate with olive oil, salt and cacao nibs was much better than I had anticipated -
  the contrast of the saltiness with the chocolate makes you savour every small mouthful.
  At first I thought why is this dessert on only exactly half of my plate,
  but trust me, this dessert works and was trumped only by the chocolate dessert at Ofrenda above.
  The venue was a candle lit date style restaurant. WiFi 112/311 Mbit/s

TODO:

- [Mare Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/v34Hrby1j9rJpYFb9) - 4.9, low key venue, must be a foodie place
- [Artisano Regocijo Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/15gKFNhBkwcmshVx5) - 4.9 looks like fine dining but was noisy
  with entertainment when I passed
- [Kushka Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/v85gKpZh14gtwDgy5) - 4.8
- [Organika Bakery & Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CXitHTBpJWZSGBC56) - 4.8

## Travel to Aguas Calientes & Machu Picchu

There is a train to Machu Picchu but it only goes from [Ollantaytambo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cXJhC46h885e6k416).
From Cusco when you buy travel, it is actually first a minibus to Ollantaytambo and then a train connection from there.

Tickets start at approximately \$85-\$99 each way as of Jan 2026, double that for first class.

These are the two travel providers to get and from Aguas Calientes / Machu Picchu:

[IncaRail](https://incarail.com/en)

[PeruRail](https://www.perurail.com/)

I took IncaRail on the way there and PeruRail on the way back just to see the difference.

The IncaRail train had a very nice interior and seats.

### Travel from Aguas Calientes to Machu Picchu

Aguas Calientes is the town at the base of Machu Picchu.

From Aguas Calientes, you can either hike for 2 hours up the mountain, or do what most people do and take a bus for
25-30 minutes.

Given you're going to be walking around Machu Picchu itself for 2 hours, you probably don't want to wear yourself out
walking up the mountain for 2 hours first just to reach the entrance to Machu Picchu
(and keep in mind the altitude which means you'll be out of breath in 5 minutes going uphill, unless you are ultra fit
and used to the altitude).

So if you're not a masochist and decide to take the bus up the mountain like a normal tourist...

#### Bus up to Machu Picchu

You'll first need to go to [Consettur Bus Ticket](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XtKWXzQP9Pzgg4ex7) office,
and then walk downhill to the [Consettur Macchu Picchu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3vqWZH8vqxyKA9Ra6) bus stop
where the buses are lined up and leaving every few minutes.

Tickets are \$12 each way, which takes around 25 minutes each way.

This is relatively pricey considering I took a bus in Ecuador for 4 hours from Montanita to Manta for \$6
which was a much greater distance, but you've come to a tourist place, so what do you expect.
And you almost certainly don't want to try to walk it.

Buses are first-come seating, and lines move fast as buses leave every few minutes.
The queue for the buses so look 200 people long and daunting in the mornings though.

The bus takes you up the mountain to the entrance of Machu Picchu, which takes around 25-30 minutes.
Buses leave every few minutes from about 5:30am until about 3:30pm.

They won't let you into Machu Picchu until literally the exactly minute of the hour of your ticket.
So there will be a crowd built up waiting to get in, which could take approximately 10-30 minutes for entrance
admission depending on how busy it is.

On the bus, sitting on the right-hand side going up is supposed to be best for views of the Urubamba River and jungle,
but the bus was steamed up so I didn't see much.

Coming down on the the bus the inverse is recommended, sitting on the left-hand.

## Aguas Calientes

This is the tourist town at the base of [Machu Picchu](#machu-picchu) which is wall to wall restaurants, sourvenir shops
and hotels/hostels, so having a day to explore it is nice.

I recommend staying here 2 nights instead of doing a very long pre-packaged day trip from Cusco which they will try to
sell you when you're there, which is actually more tiring and expensive.

It's actually cheaper to stay in Aguas Calientes for 1-2 nights and do it at your own pace.

The town is small enough that it doesn't really matter which area you stay in as you can walk across it in 10 minutes.

The first night you should immediately buy your tickets for Machu Picchu for the next day
if you don't already have them.
Visit Machu Picchu the day after arriving, and rest in the evening with dining and accommodation
before taking a train back to Cusco for the following day - hence why I did 2 nights for an ideal restful pacing.

Having time to leisurely explore the town and try 2-3 restaurants is nice.

There are a lot of dogs lounging or trotting around the town.

### ATMs in Aguas Calientes

- [Banco de la Nación](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zi2Kecw9dWfunJLT7) - no local fee cash withdrawals

### Attractions in Aguas Calientes

- [Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aQvEdueApScBC7gE9) - obviously, see the
  [Machu Picchu](#machu-picchu) section on it further down

### Restaurants in Aguas Calientes

<!--

The supertramp hostel has no kitchen unfortunately, but is otherwise ok. Except checkout is 10am instead of 11am
The on-site restaurant didn't look good and was always empty
so I didn't try it when there is so much competition for food just outside
Wifi 19/39 Mbit/s

-->

The main strip is from the town square uphill which is wall to wall restaurants and massage parlours.

- [Ayahuasca Grill](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n8CnfpXFfRK5LC5y9) -
  has various Alpaca steak dishes at reasonable price at around 50 Sol ($15).
  The alpaca chimichurri was nice and flamed in front of me. I would have preferred it a bit less rare,
  but the red sauce on the side was great, and the potato mash and vegetables were good too.
  Also has guinea pig but I couldn’t bring myself to eat that as it is a whole guinea pig.
  WiFi 244/15 Mbit/s
- [Inka Wasi Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cqcQstY6PQ5SnD8DA) - lovely internal decor and street seating,
  good quality food and service at reasonable price.
  The American style breakfast for 40 Sol (\$12) with eggs, bacon, toast, butter, strawberry jam, coffee and juice
  really set me up for the day.
  Wifi 12/16 Mbit/s

Not Recommended:

- [El Portal del Inka](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BjLfTurXCjkr9pUv7) - mediocre food at same prices as good places.
  I wish I hadn't wasted one of my meals on this place,
  I don't know how it has a 4.8 rating when the 4.8 rated places in Cusco were amazing fine dining at similar price.
  The Alpaca in Andean sauce came as a very thin overcooked steak, and the Andean yellow sauce was bland and mediocre.
  Even the rice was dried hard.
  The fried potatoes were ok.
  Has wifi

TODO:

- [Blues Rest. Bar Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CcAtwt9gc4xwKb939) - 4.8

The restaurants by the train track overlooking the river seem to have some good ratings but higher tourist prices, often
exceeding that of the finest restaurants in Cusco.

## Machu Picchu

### Machu Picchu Tickets

Tickets sell out far in advance online, months in advance in peak season
(June to September when the weather is the clearest for pictures and if you don't want to get rained on).

Online tickets being mostly sold out for the good trails made it stressful to try to get one - tourist BS.

This is the online booking site, which is a bit buggy:

<https://tuboleto.cultura.pe/llaqta_machupicchu>

Even in the off season in January the [Ministerio de Cultura](https://maps.app.goo.gl/o4UVBFDoUBb8Fju99) in Cusco where
you can buy tickets in person told me on Monday that the the tickets for Wednesday were already sold out online and
to go to [Aguas Calientes](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UWKshDUc1q94nwAA8) to try to buy tickets on-site there for the next
day.

This was a bit risky, but I booked an IncaRail to Aguas Calientes and a couple nights stay hoping to catch one of these
last minute on-site tickets in person:

<https://www.machupicchu.gob.pe/purchase-of-tickets-in-person/?lang=en>

There are 1,000 tickets on sale for tomorrow, available to purchase on a first come first served basis from 6am to 10pm
at the [[Ministry of Culture](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RMvYpsa4gfjnDeQx6) ticket office in Aguas Calientes,
but split between 50-600 total tickets available depending on the route.

In peak season you probably need to go early in the day to get a ticket for the next day.

I arrived by train around 6pm and immediately went straight to the
[Ministry of Culture (Machu Picchu Park Passes)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RMvYpsa4gfjnDeQx6)
before even my accommodation, in order to increase my chances to buy a ticket for the next day.

You can see the real-time number of remaining tickets available to buy today for a visit tomorrow counting down at this
website:

<https://tuboleto.cultura.pe/disponibilidad/llaqta_machupicchu>

### Machu Picchu Preparation

It's a 2 hour walk through Machu Picchu at a leisurely pace as you'll want to take lots of pictures.

There are no toilets inside, and you cannot go backwards, so make sure you go to the toilets outside before you enter!!

You cannot go backwards or on the wrong trail as the staff along the routes will blow whistles at you and order you back
to the designated route.

Umbrellas are not allowed in Machu Picchu, apparently because they are a risk with mountain winds and other people on
the trails.

This means you will likely need a plastic rain poncho,
which they sell for 5 SOL ($1.50) outside the entrance (cash only,
so make sure you've been to the [ATM in the nearby Aguas Calientes](#atms-in-aguas-calientes) first).

It rains a lot there in the misty mountains,
so unless you are going in the dry season of June to September
(coincidentally also the high season when tickets sell out months in advance),
you will likely need that poncho.

Food and drink is also not allowed inside, so make sure you eat your snacks before you go in.

Small water bottles are allowed.
