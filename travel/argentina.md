## Summary

Argentina uses the Argentine Peso (ARS) which is roughly 2,000 ARS per 1 GBP, or 1,400 ARS per 1 USD as of Feb 2026.

I used Eskimo e-sim with 10GB of global data to reuse across countries as I got a good deal and it worked out cheaper
than buying a new e-sim for each country and potentially leaving behind remaining data each time.
Note this doesn't always work out so well so compare the price per GB
as previously it worked out so expensive
to get global data that it was cheaper for me to buy just enough data per country each time.

## Buenos Aires

### Buenos Aires Airport

There are two airports,
more international flights will use the larger one, Ezeiza Airport (EZE), further out about an hour's drive
or 1.5 hour's bus ride.

Wifi worked easily without a captcha portal so I managed to sort out getting an Eskimo e-sim.

There was a water cooler outside the toilets in the baggage reclaim area.

#### Travel from Ezeiza Airport to Buenos Aires City

You can either take one of the taxi apps in the section below or take the bus which goes all the way to the centre of
Buenoes Aires for under 1,000AR (\$1), but you'll need a rechargeable SUBE travel card,
which can be purchased using contactless card payment at the _"Open 25 hs"_ store just inside the door next to
the [bus stop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SQ7ZnZVqzjSwtQE96).

The card itself costs 1,500 ($1.50), plus whatever credit you choose to add to it -
I added 1,500 just to cover the one journey.

Make sure you confirm the destination with the bus driver as it turns out there are actually 3 _"number 8"_buses and
you need the one that is going to Plaza de Mayo to take you to central Buenos Aires, as the other two versions of the
number 8 bus veer off slightly to different areas in the city near the end like La Boca which is several blocks to the
south.

### Restaurants in Buenos Aires

- [Caracol](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xjjuatgyH4kuCUbSA) - was recommended to me as a decent local
  restaurant.
  The veal milanese with fries was decent and hit the spot after
  a long day travelling into Buenos Aires.
  The fries are the home made style.
  The apple pie with vanilla ice cream was bigger than anticipated and filling.
  The place won't win any culinary awards but sits well as it's 4.4 star rating.
  Wifi didn't work for me even though it was connected at full signal strength
