## Summary

Argentina uses the Argentine Peso (ARS) which is roughly 2,000 ARS per 1 GBP, or 1,400 ARS per 1 USD as of Feb 2026.

I used Eskimo e-sim with 10GB of global data to reuse across countries as I got a good deal and it worked out cheaper
than buying a new e-sim for each country and potentially leaving behind remaining data each time.
Note this doesn't always work out so well so compare the price per GB
as previously it worked out so expensive
to get global data that it was cheaper for me to buy just enough data per country each time.

It was $100 for 30 days of glucosamine supplements due to import taxes and in some places
even the shaving cream was as expensive as Central American countries (\$12-\$15), so you'll save money if you bring
all your own western supplies.

## Buenos Aires

On the Eastern coast of South America, but really not a beach city...
there is a large nature reserve blocking the east coast and a man made north-south rectangular bay at
[Puerto Madero](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DJRA9uobRj7mVkYz7) which is considered the waterfront -
Dubai Marina it is not, however.

### Buenos Aires Airport

There are two airports,
more international flights will use the larger one, Ezeiza Airport (EZE), further out about an hour's drive
or 1.5 hour's bus ride.

Wifi worked easily without a captcha portal so I managed to sort out getting an Eskimo e-sim.

There was a water cooler outside the toilets in the baggage reclaim area.

#### Travel from Ezeiza Airport to Buenos Aires City

You can either take one of the taxi apps in the section below or take the bus which goes all the way to the centre of
Buenoes Aires for under 1,000AR (\$1), but you'll need a rechargeable SUBE travel card,
which can be purchased using contactless card payment at the _"Open 25 hs"_ store just inside the door next to
the [bus stop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SQ7ZnZVqzjSwtQE96).

The card itself costs 1,500 ($1.50), plus whatever credit you choose to add to it -
I added 1,500 just to cover the one journey.

Make sure you confirm the destination with the bus driver as it turns out there are actually 3 _"number 8"_buses and
you need the one that is going to Plaza de Mayo to take you to central Buenos Aires, as the other two versions of the
number 8 bus veer off slightly to different areas in the city near the end like La Boca which is several blocks to the
south.

### Ferry to Uruguay Montevideo

You can take the ferry from Buenos Aires to Montevideo, the capital of Uruaguay, which is just across the water.

It costs about 1/3 of the price of a plane ticket between the two cities, and you can buy it online here:

<https://www.buquebus.com/ar>

The [Buquebus Terminal](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YbYvAiSvcGGdT7p89) where you catch the ferry is in the north east of the
city near the main areas and at the north end of Puerto Madero.

There is free open wifi `Buquebus_Wifi_Free` 11/35 Mbit/s.

### Restaurants in Buenos Aires

Restaurants at the [Puerto Madero](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mtyYV2dDYqZMJZbW9) waterfront are noticably expensive as
you're indirectly paying premium rents to landlords, and Dubai Marina it is not.
The restaurants near the [Puente Azucena Villaflor bridge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1UB72jsdhqRvbPd67) are particularly badly
priced.

- [Lucciano’s San Telmo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6Ye8yZp64h8Qx46J9) - high quality ice cream gelateria, so good I went
  back 3 days in a row.
  There are two branches on broadway too at [Lucciano's Calle Corrientes](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hQUhMwHVvo5kacV58)
  and a smaller takeaway only one at [Lucciano's Obelisco](https://maps.app.goo.gl/m9pTCENNtSzbVaYv6).
  The Coco Rock with dessicated coconut is my favourite here,
  although their pistacchio is decent too (not quite the best I've ever had),
  and they have 3 chocolate flavours, I've tried one or two and they were good
  (the hazelnut one was the least rich in flavour).
  Like most pricey ice cream gelaterias you can try a 2-3 flavours before you buy.
  Their waffle cones are also good, but I didn't try their coated ones as they look like calorie overkill
- San Telmo:
  - [Mercado San Telmo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fBNUcbUJr37z3QfEA) - permanent covered street market wiht lots of food
    places and arts & crafts, closes early around 7:30pm, it was locked up before the official 8pm closing time, so this
    is a good place to get some lunch out of the midday sun
    - [EL Hornero de San Telmo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pQnNNnaMrfShpiJH7) - good empanadas (like small cornish pasties)
      for 4200 AR each ($3).
      The beef steak pieces and beef & potato ones were both so good I went back again for the same the next day
  - [Hiro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n9F1QoSv3xkkgPu96) - cafe with decent scrambled eggs breakfast,
    unfortunately they were out of the salmon add on.
    The squeeze orange juice was a good size without water or sugar, just as well since I forgot to specify that.
    WiFi 284/188 Mbit/s
  - [Nica Mercado](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Y8nReHLmVtQX7ufa6) - cafe opposite San Telmo market.
    Their granola yoghurt fruit bowl appeared modestly sized but was very satisfying.
    Has wifi but unreliable, especially at the outside seating (Speedtest kept failing)
  - [Je Suis Raclette](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9bSikW9mjoKuysoP8) - swiss, inside the indoor market.
    The beef raclette was ok, not sure it's worth the 24,000 AR (\$17).
    It's really sold on the novelty of it being a cultural swiss dish,
    which btw is heavy on cheese so if you're on a diet or not keen on cheese, you should skip this one.
    Next time I'd go for the veal in white wine mushroom sauce which was also better priced at 18,000 AR (\$13).
    Wifi 108/99 Mbit/s
  - [Caracol](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xjjuatgyH4kuCUbSA) - was recommended to me as a decent local
    restaurant.
    The veal milanese with fries was decent and hit the spot after
    a long day travelling into Buenos Aires.
    The fries are the home made style.
    The apple pie with vanilla ice cream was bigger than anticipated and filling.
    The place won't win any culinary awards but sits well as it's 4.4 star rating.
    Wifi didn't work for me even though it was connected at full signal strength
- [Jay's](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rYymAK4bvph7gGU18) - american diner.
  Decent spicy burger and thick cut fries.
  Has US news playing on 2 TVs to add to the american atmosphere - not sure this is a plus point!
  Reasonable prices but closes early in the day.
  WiFi 16/32 Mbit/s
- Puerto Madero:
  - [Fabric Sushi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mfTsQWn1z7Pr5Mbp7) - expensive, but as it's at the low footfall north end of
    Puerto Madero it's not quite as expensive as the places by the central bridges.
    The interior was nice but almost 100% empty as people chose to sit on the few outside waterfront seats.
    They were completely out of all ceviches, which is what I went there to try, and they had no physical menu,
    giving a QR code to the online menu, and no English menu at all, apparently the English translation online doesn’t
    work.
    There is lots of sushi and alcohol on the menu, sushi was ok - I wasn’t keen on the Kina,
    but the 2 Sakes and Fabric sushi rolls were ok, although I wouldn’t revisit for these at these prices.
    Has wifi

Not Recommended:

- [Big Pons](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6QxD51sZL5kCN8M67) - argentine burger chain, the Big Pons burger was less good than
  a Burger King whopper. I'd skip this entirely next time, it's not worth the curiosity.
  The outdoor seating is nicer at the [other one by the waterfront Puerto Madero waterfront](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YSXLoRvHgQpWQqrw5)
  which is why it has a higher rating as it's one of the cheapest places to eat at the waterfront.
  WiFi 23/166 Mbit/s
