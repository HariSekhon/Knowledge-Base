## Summary

[Belgium](https://maps.app.goo.gl/H4HEC1A8eUk4uuaW8) is a nice small country between France and Germany,
easy to drive to from the UK, perhaps 2-3 hours after a ferry from Dover to Calais in France.

Like Germany, it is famous for its beer culture and wide selection of beers.

Due to mass immigration it's a mixed bag of a country depending on where you go.

If you want to get the feel of Belgium, skip the capital and go to Bruges instead.

## Population

[Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beligum) has historically been a mix of dutch-speaking flemish and french
people, although over 1/3 of the country is now foreign so this has changed things somewhat.

One of my greatest managers in my career is Flemish so I might be biased into thinking they are high quality people.

Belgium's birthrates have been below replenishment for over 50 years since 1974, now an unsustainably low 1.4 children
per woman.

Reminder: 2.1 children average per woman is needed just to replenish the current adult population,
and much higher birthrates [or mass immigration replacement] is needed if you want to support an expensive democratic
ponzi scheme welfare state & pensions long term.

Belgium's population is still increasing despite this due to mass immigration,
which is obvious if you've visited its capital Brussels (one of my less favourite parts of the country):

## Antwerp

Port city, not much there from what I recall, been to a good restaurant there but can't remember its name.

## Brussels

A bit of a western capital dump with high immigration, graffiti etc.

## Bruges / Brugge

West Belgium is nicer, with Bruges having a historic town catering to tourists with restaurants, ice cream and
coffee shops.

[Marco Polo Noodles](https://www.marco-polo-noodles.com/) is recommended on the main strip.

## Ghent / Gent

City with a mix of old and new, not quite as nice as Bruges, but better than Brussels.

[Seli's Noodle Bar](https://www.selinoodlebar.be/) and [Soup Lounge](https://www.souplounge.be/) are both recommended
here, and both are very affordable.

## Liege

Liege is worse than Brussels, with high incidence of homelessness, a crime ridden feeling and people approaching you for
money in the streets.

## Waterloo

Gentrified town just south of Brussels where Napoleon lost the famous battle.

[Le Bar À Soupe](https://www.facebook.com/people/Le-Bar-%C3%A0-Soupe/100063541241931/),
Savage Burger and [Thai Cafe](https://thai.cafe/en) are recommended here, with the latter being more expensive.
