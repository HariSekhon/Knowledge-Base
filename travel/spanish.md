| Aguachile         | Raw meat or seafood in a zesty lime-chilli-cilantro sauce, served with nachos or plain untopped tostas / tostadas for you to load it up on to - this is one of my new favourite dishes, although quite extreme by western standards in both lime and chilli, start with the mildest one! |
| Tacos             | Small soft round tortillas - these are actually overrated, I prefer aguachile and tostas                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Tortas            | Sandwich - not to be confused with Tostas!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Chilaquiles       | Crispy fried tortilla chips drowned in sauce and cheese, really good, but obviously fattening!!                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Tamale            | Filling wrapped and cooked in a corn husk or banana leaf - you eat the filling and discard the leaf                                                                                                                                                                                      |
