# Denmark

## Copenhagen

I worked out here for 4 months in 2017, but I returned to the UK early
(honestly to date who became my long-term girlfriend and 2nd baby mama, the one I loved the most).

I was also glad to return to the UK because the food in Denmark was nowhere near as good as London but
twice the price.

The weather was almost identically bad to the UK.

### Restaurants in Copenhagen

- [Halifax Burger](https://www.halifax.dk/) - Denmark's equivalent burger chain to Gourmet Burger Kitchen. This was my
  goto restaurant to get a consistent good quality after being disappointed in so many other restaurants in Denmark
- [Hooked](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zApDAR1MEfCotwze7) - fast food lobster restaurant, was ok, but only ate there once
