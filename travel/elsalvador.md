## Summary

El Salvador got famous for adopting Bitcoin as legal tender
(you can see signs you can use this in the supermarket).

The country uses the US dollar as its official currency.

You will need to bring or withdraw US dollars in cash as many places do not take card,
in both accommodations and restaurants.

However, this is still a 3rd world country, which is why it abandoned its own currency for USD and BTC.

## Spanish Crash Course

See the [Spanish Crash Course](spanish.md) page.

## ATMs in El Salvador

- [Banco Hipotecario](Banco Hipotecario) - charged me no fee for a a USD withdrawal, I've confirmed this in both San Salvador and
  Santa Ana

## Long Distance Buses

[Ticabus](https://www.ticabus.com/en/) connects Central America.

I ended up not using this due to bureaucratic delays on trying to get visa for Honduras and instead flew to Costa Rica.

## Sal Salvador

The capital is noticeably more developed than Santa Ana or El Zonte, better for a foodie.

### Restaurants in San Salvador

<!--

La Zona Hostel was ok and cheap, but like the fancier looking place in El Zonte,
the showers were one tap no hot water

## Santa Ana

### Travel within Santa Ana

Your options are Uber taxies or public buses to the local attractions, volcano and nearby towns.

In Santa Ana, [Bus Terminal Francisco Lara Pineda](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uZrDW38GFPawAnFt5)
is the local bus station where you can catch public buses to the
[Tudo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BDExtbjVn7pBDrEi6) long-distance bus station, as well as local attractions in the region.

### Travel from Guatemala to Santa Ana

I took pre-arranged shuttles from Guatemala as I was working my way down Central America to South America.

I shopped around the tour operator shops in Panajachel,
Guatemala and managed to get from there to Antigua and then change to Santa Ana for a mere 450 GTQ
($58) which is almost certainly cheaper than any flight.

### Travel from Santa Ana to San Salvador

From the [Tudo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BDExtbjVn7pBDrEi6) bus station you can take the #201 bus to San Salvador for just under \$3 including luggage.

From San Salvador you can change to get another bus to El Zonte.

While the #201 bus to San Salvador, can also be caught from other locations such as Metro Centro,
it's better to take an Uber taxi to Tudo so you can get a better pick of seats for the long journey.

By the time the bus gets to Metro Centro most of the seats are full so if you want to get your pick of seats, go to
Tudo.

The #201 bus terminates at the
[Terminal de Buses de Occidente](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bSQfh2CdmiL7tLQG9) bus station.

Buses leave every 15 minutes to San Salvador until 6:30pm (double check this information hasn't changed since).

There are also a lot of people temporarily boarding to try to sell you various foods, drinks and snacks.

### Attractions in Santa Ana

The town itself doesn't have much in it, after an hour walking around the small centre with Santa Ana Cathedral you'll
want to go elsewhere.

The attractions are outside the town.

You can refer to [this local guide](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGerN-EUEc/YpGj1_h_8r2iWelBE8-K3A/edit) for
attractions and travel to nearby cities like San Salvador and El Zonte.

- [Santa Ana Volcano](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QiuRxZ2FfQupHJV26) - a 1 hour drive away, but you have to leave really
  early in the morning to take a shuttle or public but to get there before 11am for a guided tour.
  I'd just come down from Guatemala so was already volcano'd out
  and skipped on to Bitcoin Beach in El Zonte and the capital San Salvador
- [Lago de Coatepeque](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V2zTeqza7dCCGE4UA)
- [El Salto de Malacatiupán](https://maps.app.goo.gl/s1dvDV14DKRNwZqn7)
- [Parque Arqueológico Tazumal](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jsE7u4JPyzkFyy446)

in town:

- [Parque Libertad](https://maps.app.goo.gl/X6pgPiuePn7kQDFX9) - the central park in town, there is street food around
  it
- [Catedral de Nuestra Señora Santa Ana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XEccUbjFXTfVcB9H7)
- [UNASA Human Anatomy Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uWj2Ecm239fhe1FR8)
- [Western Regional Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yKmTwiDsc9CTLLudA)

### Restaurants in Santa Ana

- [Comedor y Pupuseria Claudia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9cv1kzMFQiRfgyjC7) - shockingly cheap local eats restaurant with
  live music in the evening - recommended by locals - \$1-\$1.5 per Papusa, $2.50 for soft drinks.
  The street food around [Parque Libertad](https://maps.app.goo.gl/X6pgPiuePn7kQDFX9) is even cheaper.
  Papusa are pretty fattening though as a dough full of cheese with a little bit of meat or shrimp.
  WiFi 21/22 Mbit/s
- [Súper Selectos • Santa Ana Centro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/isbLkvAMVm3j8qgZ6) - supermarket to pick up groceries or
  household items
- [Maxi Despensa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jWrSrw733u1zEayR9) - cheaper than Super Selectos above

TODO:

- [Taqueria Los Plebes](Taqueria Los Plebes) - 4.9 Mexican, affordable
- [Simmer Down](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B7h61mvu4VTnQzEz7) - 4.6, pizzas, pasta and steak

## El Zonte

Also known as _"Bitcoin Beach"_ for having pioneered accepting Bitcoin payments.

There are actually several beaches along the south coast and its not obvious which one you want.

You definitely don't want where the Google Maps drops the [El Zonte](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NxHwCKxBgo5eu1kv8)
pin and the nearby [Playa El Zonte](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6vACJGDH1fTLkpo68) as that was rocky instead of sandy.

The one 10km east at [El Tunco Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cHS4AXvVT5UFQMMRA) was better
and where you see the iconic rock outcrop in pictures and where more of the tourists, surfers, touristy restaurants and
souvenir shops are.

Given that it's 10-12km along the coast and \$6 in an Uber,
it's not worth taking a cheaper accommodation several kilometers away as you'll be adding \$12 in taxis per day,
plus the inconvenience.

Aside from a a but of surfing and ability to pay for some restaurants and groceries with bitcoin,
there isn't really anything to see here.

A mecca for bitcoin it is not.

It's more of a side effect of being a 3rd world country that they adopted bitcoin payments at legal tender
(discretionary) and USD as the official currency.

Literally as I type this I just found [The Bitcoin Hardware Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HnveBMumzJxK5deQA) the day
I left El Zonte.
Damn it.
Worth a visit if you're in the area apparently.

### Travel from San Salvador to El Zonte

From the capital San Salvador you need to take the #102A bus for \$1.50 (+\$1.50 for luggage).

Make sure the bus has the letter A on it to go all the way to the beach, otherwise don't get on it.

If you're taking the #201 bus from Santa Ana to San Salvador first, it goes to
[Terminal de Buses de Occidente](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bSQfh2CdmiL7tLQG9).

While you can get off early to catch the #102A bus from the bus stop
[Estación Ceiba de Guadalupe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tPtjwxyYfS48YSBfA)
opposite
[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LT8aDhdQAWbMHWHb6), I do not recommend it.

Firstly, you'll probably need a toilet break after 2 hours on the bus from Santa Ana,
so you should go to the final stop bus station
[Terminal de Buses de Occidente](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bSQfh2CdmiL7tLQG9) for that.

Secondly, the #102A bus almost entirely fills up at the
[Punto de buses ruta 102](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cjmUqYnhMrp5uakD6) bus station before it leaves.

So if you want a seat for the 1-2 hour journey down to the coast, go to the original bus station for #102A
[Punto de buses ruta 102](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cjmUqYnhMrp5uakD6) and get on there.

It's a 30 minute walk between [Terminal de Buses de Occidente](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bSQfh2CdmiL7tLQG9)
and [Punto de buses ruta 102](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cjmUqYnhMrp5uakD6) so if you have heavy lugggage or don't want
to sweat through your clothes then take an Uber for \$5.

### Travel from El Zonte to San Salvador

Catch the same #102A bus above from
[Punto de microbuses 102A playa El Zonte](https://maps.app.goo.gl/R8KoMwxNbxo6prxf9) or one of the stops along the route,
it wasn't so full leaving from El Zonte as it was leaving from San Salvador.

### Restaurants in El Zonte & Tunco

<!--

[Hotel El Xalli](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RZb1ou3e3YLjeZeP8), despite having a fancy pool overlooking the sea for sunset
(and smaller second pool),had only single tap showers without hot water.
What is it with these 3rd world countries, it was hot, but a warm shower is still nicer than a cold shower

[Balancé Surf & Yoga Retreat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wikGcLp3mSG4BYke9) seems worth checking, very gentrified.

-->

El Zonte:

- [Palma](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KQP4wb2aEJRapgdV6) - the beef & pork burger bowl was excellent, partly because the
  sauce was great.
  It's literally a burger patty on top of a rice and salad bowl.
  I could have eaten more of it, as it was a moderate portion size in a medium sized bowl.
  There is covered open air seating in the back.
  Wifi 8/1 Mbit/s

Tunco:

- [Surfer's Shakes](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GPUUoWY5yb5zQ8J3A) - \$6 protein shake, or \$5 smoothies... skip the
  chocolate in banana for \$1 next time, the banana came frozen and then dipped in melted chocolate, not the texture or
  flavour experience I expected on that one and I ended up leaving half of it
- [El Compa Tacos](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6rv1YausBdpA81Lp8) - the birria (stewed beef) burrito was decent, although
  standard price at \$8.50 and not that big, this is a small foodie place with no wifi and required cash
- [Neko'S Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HEKP1S6KqHzcFof59) - useful grocery store with reasonable prices (was cheaper
  for eggs than the place I used previously in El Zonte)
