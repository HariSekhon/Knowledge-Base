### Travel from Guatemala to Santa Ana

I took pre-arranged shuttles from Guatemala as I was working my way down Central America to South America.

I shopped around the tour operator shops in Panajachel,
Guatemala and managed to get from there to Antigua and then change to Santa Ana for a mere 450 GTQ
($58) which is almost certainly cheaper than any flight.

### Travel from Santa Ana to San Salvador

In Santa Ana, [Bus Terminal Francisco Lara Pineda](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uZrDW38GFPawAnFt5)
is the local bus station where you can catch public buses to the
[Tudo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BDExtbjVn7pBDrEi6) long-distance bus station, as well as local attractions in the region.

From [Tudo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BDExtbjVn7pBDrEi6)
you can take buses to San Salvador, where you can also change to get another bus to El Zonte.

You need the #201 bus to San Salvador.
But this can also be caught from other locations such as Metro Centro,
but it's better to take an Uber taxi to Tudo so you can get a seat for the long journey.

By the time the bus gets to Metro Centro most of the seats are full so if you want to get your pick of seats, go to
Tudo.

The #201 bus terminates at the
[Terminal de Buses de Occidente](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bSQfh2CdmiL7tLQG9) bus station.

Buses leave every 15 minutes to San Salvador until 6:30pm (double check this information hasn't changed since).

There are also a lot of people temporarily boarding to try to sell you various foods, drinks and snacks.

### Attractions in Santa Ana

The town itself doesn't have much in it, after an hour walking around the small centre with Santa Ana Cathedral you'll
want to go elsewhere.

The attractions are outside the town.

You can refer to [this local guide](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGerN-EUEc/YpGj1_h_8r2iWelBE8-K3A/edit) for
attractions and travel to nearby cities like San Salvador and El Zonte.

- [Santa Ana Volcano](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QiuRxZ2FfQupHJV26) - a 1 hour drive away, but you have to leave really
  early in the morning to take a shuttle or public but to get there before 11am for a guided tour.
  I'd just come down from Guatemala so was already volcano'd out
  and skipped on to Bitcoin Beach in El Zonte and the capital San Salvador
- [Lago de Coatepeque](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V2zTeqza7dCCGE4UA)
- [El Salto de Malacatiupán](https://maps.app.goo.gl/s1dvDV14DKRNwZqn7)
- [Parque Arqueológico Tazumal](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jsE7u4JPyzkFyy446)

in town:

- [Parque Libertad](https://maps.app.goo.gl/X6pgPiuePn7kQDFX9) - the central park in town, there is street food around
  it
- [Catedral de Nuestra Señora Santa Ana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XEccUbjFXTfVcB9H7)
- [UNASA Human Anatomy Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uWj2Ecm239fhe1FR8)
- [Western Regional Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yKmTwiDsc9CTLLudA)

### Restaurants in Santa Ana

- [Comedor y Pupuseria Claudia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9cv1kzMFQiRfgyjC7) - shockingly cheap local eats restaurant with
  live music in the evening - recommended by locals - \$1-\$1.5 per Papusa, $2.50 for soft drinks.
  The street food around [Parque Libertad](https://maps.app.goo.gl/X6pgPiuePn7kQDFX9) is even cheaper.
  Papusa are pretty fattening though as a dough full of cheese with a little bit of meat or shrimp.
  WiFi 21/22 Mbit/s
- [Súper Selectos • Santa Ana Centro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/isbLkvAMVm3j8qgZ6) - supermarket to pick up groceries or
  household items
- [Maxi Despensa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jWrSrw733u1zEayR9) - cheaper than Super Selectos above

TODO:

- [Taqueria Los Plebes](Taqueria Los Plebes) - 4.9 Mexican, affordable
- [Simmer Down](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B7h61mvu4VTnQzEz7) - 4.6, pizzas, pasta and steak

## El Zonte

Also known as _"Bitcoin Beach"_ for having pioneered accepting Bitcoin payments.

### Travel from San Salvador to El Zonte

From the capital San Salvador you need to take the #102A bus.

Make sure the bus has the letter A on it to go all the way to the beach, otherwise don't get on it.

If you're taking the #201 bus from Santa Ana to San Salvador first, it goes to
[Terminal de Buses de Occidente](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bSQfh2CdmiL7tLQG9).

While you can get off early to catch the #102A bus from the bus stop
[Estación Ceiba de Guadalupe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tPtjwxyYfS48YSBfA)
opposite
[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LT8aDhdQAWbMHWHb6), I do not recommend it.

Firstly, you'll probably need a toilet break after 2 hours on the bus from Santa Ana,
so you should go to the final stop bus station
[Terminal de Buses de Occidente](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bSQfh2CdmiL7tLQG9) for that.

Secondly, the #102A bus almost entirely fills up at the
[Punto de buses ruta 102](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cjmUqYnhMrp5uakD6) bus station before it leaves.

So if you want a seat for the 1-2 hour journey down to the coast, go to the original bus station for #102A
[Punto de buses ruta 102](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cjmUqYnhMrp5uakD6) and get on there.
