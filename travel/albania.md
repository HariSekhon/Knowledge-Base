_"Cheap and good"_ was how several people I met on my travels described
[Albania](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gEyUuDhZapAQ1b5dA). Get it before it changes.

I'm surprised how many Mercedes there were in Albania.
Many 20 years old, but many modern designs with customizations, AMGs etc.

Some of the roads aren't great though.

## ATMs in Albania

ATMs in Albania usually charge you 600-700 leks (€6-€7) for a cash withdrawal,
on top of trying to get you to accept their ridiculous conversion fees
(always select Without Conversion as your bank may change you 3% but not some outrageous amount like they do).

Raiffeisen Bank ATMs were the worst I saw, trying to charge 800 leks (€8) for a cash withdrawal. Avoid that bank.

This means it's better to estimate how much you need for your stay
and withdraw it once instead of incurring the withdrawal charge again and again.

Most places take credit and debit cards, but not under a certain amount such as 500 leks (€5),
and some places will only accept cash so you will likely need some cash.

## Taxis in Albania

The usual big names of Uber and Bolt aren't present.

- [Speed Taxi](https://speedtaxi.al/) - used this, more expensive than VrapOn Taxi. Only payment option was cash
- [VrapOn Taxi](https://vrapon.al/) -
  cheaper but not in English and didn't accept the SMS verification codes so I couldn't get it working in time.
  Only payment option was cash

## Driving in Albania

**Beware: UK car insurance only covers the EU and one or two other countries like Switzerland and maybe Serbia, but**
**NOT Albania**.

**You will likely be forced to buy specific car insurance for Albania at a high price if you cannot prove you have an**
**insurance specifically covering Albania.**

Albania has _the_ worst roads I've seen in Europe with many places having unpaved roadswith everybody forced to drive
15-20mph over jagged stones and potholes and hoping your tyres don't get punctured.

Fuel is also surprisingly expensive compared to nearby Bulgaria and Romania.

## Tirana

The capital [Tiranë](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NpB1ebWNjGFn6X2f9) is cheap, with hostels costing around £10 per night.

The [Hostel Albania Villa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/W3QgHAJusgWU9fY99) only had a couple parking spaces,
I was lucky to get one.

[Trip'n'Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wPZMw8J1ayfejN2C6) seemed to be more popular among those who didn't need parking.

- [Blloku](https://maps.app.goo.gl/h6vq5NJFVdBU7Cip6) - upmarket district with night life and boutique shopping, lots of
  Mercedes, Range Rovers and Porches there
- [Nalu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EjXzGeANQ7SQ2g6aA) - excellent restaurant slightly off the beaten track, great food,
  locals who want to eat well, eat here. Prices are moderate, but worth it.
  The shrimp taco is very good with tempura shrimp, tomato, avocado, red onion and sweet chili - and at only €2.50 for
  each one, you have to try at least one.
  The linguine seafood is more expensive than at Bati, I didn't try it on this occasion to compare if it's worth the
  difference.
  The grilled octopus with confit cherry tomatoes and pepper cream was good with large tentacles as one would expect,
  and large parmesan flakes to garnish the orange coating the octopus.
  The greek salad was twice the size I expected, like a main plate with large slabs of feta on top, easily enough for 2
  people to share as a side, I finished it but had to leave one slab of feta as I was feta'd out.
  The milk baklava cake comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and is worth the fattening.
  This place deserves its 5 star rating
- [Bati Restaurant 1](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4CS4bZ8q2qzMhMys7) /
  [Bati Restaurant 2](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jskFtGmr5dycse6v9) /
  [Bati Restaurant 3](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SaZ8M282q9p75Myk6) - excellent upmarket seafood restaurant at surprisingly
  reasonable prices, good decor, ambience, and trendy pop music (many from my Upbeat & Sexual Pop
  [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/harisekhon)).
  This is a good place to bring a date. All three have the same menu.
  These have got to be among the best restaurants in Tirana, and deserve the high rating.
  Bati 2 is just off the main road such that I passed it twice trying to find it, but a hidden gem,
  busy, filled with locals even on a Wednesday night - had to wait for a table.
  The food was very good quality, although most of the fish dishes are priced by weight,
  which means they are not for people on a budget, but thankfully the seafood linguine was very reasonably priced at
  600 leks (€6).
  The tomato, garlic and parmesan bruschetta were a perfect starter - 6 small, slightly salty, bruschetta with tomato
  and parmesan flakes.
  I don't recall having better bruschetta than these anywhere, and for 250 leks (€2.50) you have to have them.
  The seafood linguine was similarly perfect, with al dente pasta, and a mix of seafood including prawns, octopus and
  muscles. It's not a big portion, a large bowl plate with the centre filled. This left space for dessert though.
  The _"Baked Cheesecake"_ is actually a Basque Burnt style cheesecake which does not have a biscuit base
  and comes with a caramelized top and a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side, and only a few crumbs of biscuit
  garnish on the side.
  If you're thinking of New York style cheesecake with the biscuit base,
  you need to choose the plain cheesecake, not the baked one.
  The waiter's English wasn't that good so they failed to distinguish the difference properly, saying one was baked and
  came with ice cream but forgot to mention there was no biscuit base.
  The chef gave me an additional regular cheesecake when I queried why there was no biscuit base.
  Comparing the two, the Basque Burnt style _"Baked Cheesecake"_
  was the perfect amount of subtle sweetness, while the New York style cheesecake with apricot sauce on it was much
  sweeter.
  The only point I could possibly deduct for this place was
  that they had no juices, at all leaving me to buy mineral water in glass bottle.
  Wifi 92/34 Mbit/s
- [Jarna Traditional Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qVvfQq6ktSNVtrH3A) - traditional Albanian restaurant,
  moderately priced, by the same owner as Bati restaurant trio above, and just round the corner from Bati 1.
  The homemade bread is amazing and comes hot with a dense texture.
  At only €1 you _have_ to have it, maybe two, and an extra one to take away!
  Pair it with the yoghurt starter which is similar to Greek tzatziki and goes really well together.
  The Lakror is like a big 16” pizza, enough for 2-3 people.
  The mains are meat heavy and priced by weight at 3000 leks per kg with minimum 400g order (1200 leks).
  The veal ribs skewer was decent and tender but at 400g hard to get through (perhaps for a post workout recovery day!).
  Next time I might try the "lamb or goat in a sack".
  More of a place for meat lovers as all the mains are meat except for the lakror.
  The Kasata Bllaca is an interesting neopolitan type multi-layered ice cream with some sweet fruit bits and sauce,
  like the homemade bread, I would definitely get this again too
- [Odas Garden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ynkfuUvCcwV8KqcB7) - good food, moderate prices, very popular.
  It was recommended by one of my fellow foodie travel buddies.
  This place is apparently not a well kept secret at all as the place was packed out, and we had to queue for half an
  hour from 7:30-8pm on a Tuesday night to get a table.
  The waiting area became full of groups of people waiting for tables by the time we were seated.
  You would be well advised to book a table, especially if it's the weekend.
  The lamb cooked in a wooden stove was a good sized portion of meat,
  although some of the lamb was a bit dry and hard to get through, and came with potato slices.
  The veal chop was a decent size too.
  The Japrak (rice in grape vine leaves)
  looks quite different to the better known Greek style
  as the leaves were a light rather than dark green colour and came with few very large bundles,
  but tasted similarly good.
  The venue also had live traditional music, even on Tuesday evening,
  which was good but honestly too loud which makes it hard to talk,
  and we were sitting at the end of the garden nowhere near the band.
  They also charge 220 leks for live music per person on the bill too (just over €2)
- [PMG Steakhouse & Burgers](https://maps.app.goo.gl/v1LhaaoMNZwhHV6G6) - fillet steak burger for €10 comes with a thin
  fillet beef instead of a minced meat burger, was pretty good, comes with a few fries.
  They have no juices unfortunately
- [Yogurteria Tirana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eJP8QttrjUnKoDv6A) /

  [Yogurteria Tirana, Bllok](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ckpi33kTVa5GJugL8) - frozen yoghurt and ice cream chain.
  The first and second ones are on the ground and top floor of the Toptani Mall,
  the third is in the upmarket Blloku area.
  The frozen yoghurt is very tasty, shame they're not more generous with toppings
- [Old Bazaar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KdhgSnjCqVmNEWRSA)
- [Pyramid of Tirana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1vLsae32cALGSmGY6) - modern monstrosity of a pyramid for tourists to get
  views and pics of the city
- [Woodrow Wilson Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kkvkBFFBEe1Cybz86) roundabout in Blloku - several coffee shops and
  restaurants around it
- [Toptani Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tfcu7TzA3m6tb9ui7) - the main mall in this area, with some brand shops, a
  supermarket on the -1 floor, 4th floor is mainly baby stuff, top floor has a Yogurteria
- [Stoa Meeting Place](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5CY84b3Coy1S7LFR6) - bar which had live outdoor music of a talented guy
  on guitar singing classic pop-rock songs, part of a pub crawl
- [Destil Creative Hub](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JHfvrEnNJVeqsc339) - recommended by a friend for food and service
  during the day, but at night it turned into a bar with karaoke - also part of a pub crawl

TODO:

There are a lot of restaurants with good ratings such as 4.7,

- [Il Paese 31](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sK3uAjG4LueuxKVAA) - looks good quality, but a bit quiet because it's on a side
  street in Blloku, take your date here to keep her to yourself for a quiet romantic evening
- [KOPE Steak House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JtPTtnxdjMhACvUUA) - by the same owner as the Bati restaurant trio above,

- ["Small and more" cocktail bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MthK65kGmXKB6FRc9) - popular cocktail bar in the upmarket
  Blloku area, next to Nouvelle Vague and My Way - the busiest of the three of them on a Friday night
- [Nouvelle Vague Tirana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6sBrB9zADb9s2y6f6) - highly recommended bar by a guy I met in Zadar,
  and has a very high rating, on a small side street in the upmarket Blloku area

  which is everywhere
- [Mon Cheri - Bllok](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6WPZgxZt3FXXEjuh7) - if you're gonna try this coffee shop chain, try this
  one in the best area Blloku
- [Mystic Restaurant 2](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7opZ6YiWM1ZiBNat8) - restaurant in Blloku

  video games

## Lake Bovilla

[Lake Bovilla](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bbsLa4sqKCJTi6zc8)
has great scenary but just one several km long unpaved rock filled road with potholes everywhere is the only way up or
down, and turns with no guardrails.

This is the worst _"road"_ I've ever seen in Europe.

I seriously thought I was going to puncture my tyres driving over such a large amount of jagged stones for such a long
way.

I'd hate to see the undercarriage of my car now, since a Mercedes AMG lowered body kit is exactly the wrong car
for this type of terrain, and I wouldn't have taken it had I known.

If I was to go here again, I'd rent a 4x4 SUV to take the wear and tear instead - 4x4 since on a couple of occasions
my 2 wheel drive slipped it's wheels on some steep gradients.

- [Bovilla restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JrF4wcaA39dfRdUq6) - the single restaurant at the top of mountain, has
  fresh squeeze orange juice, with a great view,
  but I didn't stay for dinner as I was scared of damaging my car tyres and getting stranded if trying
  to drive back down in the dark, never mind the potential of going off one of the edges!

## Durres

Good seaside town approximately 40-60 mins drive from Tirana, depending on traffic.

Unfortunately it's split into two parts by the large docks and industrial cargo containers area in the middle.

The area north of the docks is not that big, you can cover it in an hour.

The area south of the docks is much larger as it runs for miles along the beach.

If you only have time for one area,
make sure you prioritize the south which has the long stretch of beach and most of the best restaurants.

The south area is where the real action is.

- [L'avenir](https://maps.app.goo.gl/daX7wtn33M72dHKj6) - popular restaurant with outdoor beachside seating on the main
  strip to see everybody go by, as well as a busy indoor seating area with larger tables for groups.
  Overall a decent venue with good rating.
  Food wise it's decent, but not the best like Nalu or Bati in Tirana.
  The mixed bruschetta are worth a try for only €3.50 since there are 8 of them of 4 varieties,
  but I preferred the 6 classic tomato, garlic and parmesan bruschetta at Bati above in Tirana.
  The l'avenir salad was decent with a few almond flakes, pieces of orange,
  dried apricot and sultanas throughout (waitress said pomegranate but they must have run out),
  which jazzed it up a bit, although relatively a bit pricey at €7.50.
  The grilled mixed seafood came on a big plate
  but wasn't a lot of food sitting in the middle, especially for €14, with a drizzle around the outside -
  3 squid heads, 2 prawns, 1 small octopus and another flat piece of squid,
  which 2 potato wedges, 2 carrot pieces, 1 broccoli and 1 cauliflower floret.
  A bit too measured out and not generous enough.
  The Rosse Lemonade is just Fentimans Rose Lemonade with a half passionfruit to make it look fancy,
  a bit of a mark up at €4 compared to the other soft drinks at €1.80.
  Wifi 55/57 Mbit/s
- [Yogurteria Durrës](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zdHpqS3aarWcYGYt7) - frozen yoghurt chain, cool relief on a hot seaside
  day. The frozen yoghurt is very tasty, shame they're not more generous with toppings

TODO:

- [Meison Bistro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zgZM8fu8SjKhYjeL7)

## Elbasan

[Elbasan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ob7f42c3BgAYqkFB6) is a town with a small fort, useful for stopover between Tirana and
Pogradec.

- [Coffee House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/x6X58wAa5bPSHTV47) - has fresh squeezed orange juice, perfect for a stopover
  refreshment with nice decor and both indoor and outdoor seating. Cash only
- [Elbasan Castle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iiMfbHCvSjsvhbTC9) - small local castle
- [King Mosque, Elbasan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/k5NrGtQyCE3SB9Z99)
- [Ethnographic Museum of Elbasan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pPiKWTrC8oxs5V2h7)

TODO:

- [Pastiçeri Marsi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hKnVwcZbrpCe2djb9) - dessert shop
- [Art Coffee Bistro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/J4vy7A59QfLKiNyR9)
- [Piceri Dibra](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dTThcq5g6Y86KvEX9) - cafe restaurant
- [Presto Pasta Elbasan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/camCKopH2EYzTSDL7)

## Pogradec

[Pogradec](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pwQsVo8vCE35UdKa6) is a lakeside town next to the impressive and scenic
[Lake Ohrid](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zTx4seuagWd5CLF77) - amazing clear blue waters surrounded by mountain ranges,
picture perfect, with a long beachside promenade and good restaurants.

This is definitely one to revisit.

- [Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NX6tv6JP1pJ23yi47)
- Parking - the north end of the beach above has an area of free parking, but beware, don't park
  in the bays facing the street - people parked on the street in front of those bays and completely blocked me in -
  I couldn't pull out and had to wait for them to return and move their car before I could leave!
- [Restorant Zgara Familjare](https://maps.app.goo.gl/azPLdHLA4sDJze8z9) - the grilled Koran fish is a must try here as
  it is local to the Ohrid Lake.
  It comes without any sides, so accompany it with the green peppers cooked in a light cheese sauce and olive oil base,
  which is a good size for a side.
  The homemade bread is good, but unfortunately I had it the night after Jarna in Tirana, which is a different level.
  This one is not as good as Jarna's as it doesn't come freshly hotly baked.
  I coupled it with tzatziki again, but the tzatziki was mediocre - needs more cucumber and *lot* more garlic, it's
  bland by Greek standards.
  They have a single homemade dessert,
  which is like a small baklava with 2 orange slices on the side,
  which was nice but too small to be satisfying as it was half the size of the one at Nalu in Tirana.
  They don't have freshly squeezed orange juice though, but neither do the neighbouring restaurants
- [Oborri Familjar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/T234X1Fy3hNvLR7v6) - highly rated fish restaurant but they only accept cash
  and I didn't want to get mugged by an Albanian ATM again taking out cash, and then being stuck with unused leks.
  Next time

## Shkoder

[Shkodër](https://maps.app.goo.gl/M9ekVnhoA2WqawkYA) is a northern town on the Shkodra Lake, people also visit it for
the hiking trails.

In peak summer time it can be difficult to find accommodation as tourists descend on it for the lake and hiking trails.

The town itself only takes an hour to walk around so you can do this in a day trip or 1 night stopover.

- [Rruga Kolë Idromeno](https://maps.app.goo.gl/njNH3Wuo5VD4dKd47) - main tourist strip with restaurants
- [Rruga G'juhadol](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GfScSxTKQNEbr85E9) - main tourist side road with bars and restaurants at the
  north end
- [90 Pods hostel & co-working](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yQzQWPwJ8He6tx9dA) - very minimalist, only use it if you're on
  a budget. The "free parking" is street parking, which is in short supply and of course dangerous to leave a decent
  car. The car park opposite was €2 per 8 hours.
  On the plus side though, this hostel includes breakfast until 10:30am,
  with a whole trays of eggs, bread, cream cheese,
  piles of fresh natural looking imperfect tomatoes and cucumbers to make your own breakfast.
  Unfortunately, there isn't enough cookware or utensils so you have to wait for others to finish and wash up.
  It wouldn't hurt for them to buy a couple more pans and spatulas

TODO:

- [Ricordi Burger](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4RSL4PJrmrYjzzBk8) - highly rated burger restaurant with better prices than

Not Recommended:

- [OPA Shkodër](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LGvFrPyQv2RMZiyB6) - overrated.
  The smash burger looked quite squished, like the classic
  meltdown scene the guy has for getting a flat burger that looks nothing like the juicy burger in the picture in the
  classic movie [Falling Down](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106856/).
  It tasted ok, but certainly not a gourmet burger by any stretch.
  The fries were like those dry chokey crinkle cut oven fries you get from the supermarket.
  I wish I had managed to eat at Ricordi Burger above but they closed due to "family issues" at 11pm that day.
  If ever trying OPA again, next time I'd go with the 4x chicken skewers and fries, it doesn't cost much more
