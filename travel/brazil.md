### Taxi Apps in Rio de Janeiro

Taxis were hard to come by at times, possibly due to the Rio Carnival

- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/br/en/) - used Uber here, not InDrive, since there was no real price difference
- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/en-br)

### Restaurants in Rio de Janeiro

The guarana drink you see in many places in Brazi contains 35g of sugar, which is half your daily intake in a single
drink, so don't drink that.

- [Churrascaria Matinadas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Dn5RskppfszzNGua7) - popular affordable barbeque meats and buffet
  serf-service restaurant. They weigh the meat, so only take what you want, and put it on a separate plate so it is
  weighed separately
