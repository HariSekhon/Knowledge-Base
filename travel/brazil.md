## Summary

Brazil is a 3rd world country of great natural beauty but also stark wealth inequality,
crime, homelessness and topless guys digging through trash bins in many locations across Rio.

It is easily one of the most mixed race countries in the world so you never know what "a brazilian" actually looks like
as there is not a clear cut stereotype as there is in many other mostly homogenous countries.

## Rio de Janeiro

A lot of places in Rio smell of urine, and there are a lot of homeless people asleep on the dirty streets.

### RIOgaleão International Airport

Uber has it's own section as you exit and turn left and follow the road and signs around for 5-6 minutes,
but it had long wait times for an Uber to pick up your request (possibly due to it being carnival time),
so you might want to order as you are exiting the airport while you walk to the pickup area.

### Taxi Apps in Rio de Janeiro

Taxis were hard to come by at times, possibly due to the Rio Carnival

- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/br/en/) - used Uber here, not InDrive, since there was no real price difference
- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/en-br)

### Best Areas to Stay in Rio de Janeiro

- [Copacabana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5tmKCJLnZJnN8jLc9) -
  upmarket neighbourhood with the famous beach as well as most of the well rated restaurants and better Zona Sul
  gentrified supermarkets
- [Ipanema](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cjSVKnqMP3GsXhkx5) - upmarket area just west of Copacabana with an extensive beach
  and expensive restaurants
- [São Conrado](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WGvTezc8zy2dfQJn8) - upmarket area with luxury condos and hotels further west
  along the south coast from Copacabana

Not Recommended:

- Centro or any neighbouring north eastern area (many places smell of urine and there are many homeless people)
- North West - near the airport, the opposite end of the good part of town Copacabana
- Rocinha - the favela (ghetto), where drug dealers roam around with guns

### Attractions in Rio de Janeiro

- [Cristo Redentor](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KNfZtNU69oLpfh1Y9) - the famous giant statue of Jesus and viewpoint
  overlooking the city
- Zona Sul (South Zone):
  - [Copacabana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LjCwzbvA5V57JPf87) Beach - the main tourist area with long beach, calisthenic bars, beach drink huts,
    market stalls opposite the beach and many of the high end restaurants:
    - [Praia do Leme](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LjCwzbvA5V57JPf87) - beach
    - [Praia de Copacabana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/27P5kLdYEcxvQiqo8) - beach
    - [Mureta do Leme](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vyFww9BDRXtvSK8h6) - scenic spot
  - [Ipanema](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WTJVshd3gq6hhoPw7):
    - [Praia de Ipanema](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aa4os6t6YXDc9KBN7) - beach
    - [Praia do Leblon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vEFNFs9s5XJtdLzK7) - beach
    - [Mirante do Leblon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/r7wn6wFeTKJBGWAz7) - observation deck
    - [Pedra do Arpoador](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NBJBoh34kSwAGTp29) - scenic spot
  - [São Conrado](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9kSnoV8DkRDoZcWY8):
    - [Praia de São Conrado / Praia da Gávea](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wxNyaH8SJ4WQ1SseA) - beach
    - [Praia do Pepino](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WkgDvTo3qBM8zev79) - beach
    - [Fashion Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MaViWRCTxgkWS3Br9) - small with a lot of vacant units, nothing compared to
      fashion malls in other countries - I wouldn't travel to this again
- [Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PDCk36mhCowVAG1r5)
  - [Pier da Lagoa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/36jsrkrj5PR66GBf6)
- [Rocinha](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2BX26gWchZmcTceK8) - favela with tours and a tourist market.
  There are literally guys with guns and assault rifles walking down the alleyways, past you, so keep your phone and
  sunglasses tucked away. One of them literally had a gold AK-47.
  I'm not quite sure why anyone who has come from poverty would ever want to revisit such a place but my friend roped me
  into it.
  They love to mention how they are the only favela to have a metro subway stop 🙄 and how they have a free school for
  all ages, a free hospital and free sports centre.
  One astute tourist asked who pays for all that - to which the tour guide answered _"The Government"_ - as though that
  wasn't just money stolen from productive people's earnings via taxes, thereby reducing their birthrates
  (see [Idiocracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP2tUW0HDHA)).
  - Overall, you could just take the same public motorbike ride from the line of available drivers at
    [this triangle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xc21Ro6uoLn77G4h9) up to the top for 10 BRL
    (5 BRL for a local, 10 BRL for a tourist = \$2) and then walk down from the viewpoints to the market by yourself
    without having to pay \$26 for a tour guide to go to free places:
  - [Via Ápia da Rocinha](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bSZyC3A8HDhGE6Kn8) - commercial tourist street with street stalls,
    shops and restaurants.
    This is a bit of a tourist place though as a t-shirt here costs 150 BRL (\$29) which is ridiculous given I rarely
    pay more than \$5-\$7 around the world and for these and my friend bought one I recommended for 40 BRL (\$7.70) from
    a stall opposite the nicer Copacabana beach
  - [Terraço da Vila](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6q522R9w7EhqCHBn8) - rooftop viewpoint
  - [Mirante Rocinha](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZujiY1T5DmABYnZe7) - chic bar restaurant with a good view
- [Sambadrome Marquês de Sapucaí](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nn8i4XwfXRVCJpDf9) - stadium that hosts the official
  Rio Carnival dance competition

#### Rio Carnival

It is best to avoid carnival time as you'll be price gouged on accommodation costs.

#### Tours in Rio de Janeiro

**Do not book tours of Rio, it is a waste of money.**

My friend booked a one day tour of the city for \$120 - this is a huge waste of money.

They just take people to a church,
which is free to enter, the Escadaria Selarón steps,
which is also a free attraction of a few colourful steps where tourists take photographs,
and then the main attraction, the big Christ the Redeemer statue, which is \$16 per ticket, and a buffet lunch at a mere
4.1 rated restaurant (which doesn't include drinks or desserts) worth around \$10.

Instead, you could just take a couple taxis for \$5 each, pay one entrance for \$16, get a better lunch and save
yourself at least \$70-\$80 out of the \$120 for the day's costs.

### Restaurants in Rio de Janeiro

The guarana drink you see in many places in Brazi contains 35g of sugar, which is half your daily intake in a single
drink, so don't drink that.

The acai is also high in sugar and unhealthy as a result.

- [Churrascaria Matinadas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Dn5RskppfszzNGua7) - popular affordable barbeque meats and buffet
  serf-service restaurant. They weigh the meat, so only take what you want, and put it on a separate plate so it is
  weighed separately

Not Recommended:

- [Aconchego Carioca](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zqqPs2eKHLK7dbFy5) - they only had a single English menu,
  which didn't have the prices, so you'd have to cross reference with the portugese menu.
  For drinks we tried the Brazilian herb iced tea which was so bad my friend sent it back and got a cranberry house soda
  instead.
  The Peito Bovino com Pao de Alho starter was far too salty, I would not order that again.
  The shrimp curry in a coconut is bland as hell,
  although my Nigerian friend rated it highly as it reminded him of Nigerian food but according to him
  with a Thai influence,
  although I consider that an insult to Thai food which is never ever that bland, neither in London where we're from,
  nor in Thailand.
  The fried cassava powder was like mixing couscous and sand and then removing any flavour, it tasted of nothing -
  I literally couldn't bring myself eat it as it just dried out my mouth without any benefit, and the starch-style
  thickened bland shrimp curry wasn't helping to balance it.
  The desserts were the best part - the Bolo Gelato de Coco (coconut _"cake"_) was moist like Triliche rather than
  sponge like a cake as per the translation.
  The Pudim de Cachaça (similar to white rum alcohol but made from sugarcane) dessert with hard caramelized top was my
  favourite, although it is very sweet - my teeth were badly furred up from bacterial plaque within 5 minutes of eating
  dessert.

- [Bar e Restaurante Social Trapia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4QTgWS1weHCo222P6) - recommended by my favela tour guide

### Supermarkets in Rio de Janeiro

- Zona Sul - the main gentrified supermarket, but even there the fresh produce is often off and people are picking up
  and testing every time carefully before putting it in their basket.
  It has nothing on the supermarkets in the UK

### Cautionary Stories from Rio de Janeiro

For example, while a guy was passed out face down on the concrete floor in the park by a concrete bench,
another guy took his shoes off him to steal them and walk off along with his black bin bag of whatever else swag he
already had.
My big Nigerian friend noticed this and suggested we intervene so we walked across the park to intercept the thief.
My friend tells the thief very sternly to give those shoes back - a standoff ensues while the guy measures the two of us
up - before the local vagabond eventually backs down, and returns the shoes to the still unconscious man.

I ask a passing girl walking her dogs a few feet away from the still unconscious man
if it is normal to see people passed out like this in broad daylight,
and she says yes unfortunately and it's horrible and then scurries along.
Another local woman then walks over after the danger of the vagabond has passed as I'm trying to wake the man up, and
she rolls him slightly and places his the shoes under him so nobody else steals them.

We then go for a coconut drink across from the park
and as I walk 2 feet away from where we are sitting at the bar stools to put a straw wrapper in the bin,
a guy walks past and stares at my potentially unattended bag on the counter until he sees me walk back behind him before it can be swiped.

My friend has already had enough of the area within 5 minutes
because you can't even put your bag down to have a drink without worrying someone will immediately steal it,
as more homeless people patrol past.
We finish our drinks quickly and move on.

Another day,
a big muscular african american guy we meet at Copacabana beach, who has lived in Brazil for 2 years,
is walking with us while we're exchanging travel tips and going to get dinner together.
I tell him I'll write the name of a travel place I recommended on his phone when he struggles to understand the spelling
of the name, and he declines to take his phone out for fear of being mugged / it being snatched.

## Travelling Between Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paolo

Flights were expensive, between £200-£400 at short notice, while buses were around £20, although takes longer at around
6-7 hours.
