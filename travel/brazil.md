## Summary

Brazil is a 3rd world country of great natural beauty but also stark wealth inequality and crime.

It is easily one of the most mixed race countries in the world so you never know what "a brazilian" actually looks like
as there is not a clear cut stereotype as there is in many other mostly homogenous countries.

## Rio de Janeiro

A lot of places in Rio smell of urine, and there are a lot of homeless people asleep on the dirty streets.

### RIOgaleão International Airport

Uber has it's own section as you exit and turn left and follow the road and signs around for 5-6 minutes,
but it had long wait times for an Uber to pick up your request (possibly due to it being carnival time),
so you might want to order as you are exiting the airport while you walk to the pickup area.

### Taxi Apps in Rio de Janeiro

Taxis were hard to come by at times, possibly due to the Rio Carnival

- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/br/en/) - used Uber here, not InDrive, since there was no real price difference
- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/en-br)

### Best Areas to Stay in Rio de Janeiro

- [Copacabana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5tmKCJLnZJnN8jLc9) -
  this is the primary neighbourhood for tourists in the South East of the city.
  It has the famous beach promenade as well as most of the well rated restaurants and better Zona Sul gentrified
  supermarkets

Not Recommended:

- Centro (smells)
- North West

### Attractions in Rio de Janeiro

- [Copacabana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LjCwzbvA5V57JPf87) - the main tourist area:
  - [Praia do Leme](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LjCwzbvA5V57JPf87) - beach
  - [Praia de Copacabana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/27P5kLdYEcxvQiqo8) - beach

#### Rio Carnival

It is best to avoid carnival time as you'll be price gouged on accommodation costs.

#### Tours in Rio de Janeiro

**Do not book tours of Rio, it is a waste of money.**

My friend booked a one day tour of the city for \$120 - this is a huge waste of money.

They just take people to a church,
which is free to enter, the Escadaria Selarón steps,
which is also a free attraction of a few colourful steps where tourists take photographs,
and then the main attraction, the big Christ the Redeemer statue, which is \$16 per ticket, and a buffet lunch at a mere
4.1 rated restaurant (which doesn't include drinks or desserts) worth around \$10.

Instead, you could just take a couple taxis for \$5 each, pay one entrance for \$16, get a better lunch and save
yourself at least \$70-\$80 out of the \$120 for the day's costs.

### Restaurants in Rio de Janeiro

The guarana drink you see in many places in Brazi contains 35g of sugar, which is half your daily intake in a single
drink, so don't drink that.

The acai is also high in sugar and unhealthy as a result.

- [Churrascaria Matinadas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Dn5RskppfszzNGua7) - popular affordable barbeque meats and buffet
  serf-service restaurant. They weigh the meat, so only take what you want, and put it on a separate plate so it is
  weighed separately

### Supermarkets in Rio de Janeiro

- Zona Sul - the main gentrified supermarket, but even there the fresh produce is often off and people are picking up
  and testing every time carefully before putting it in their basket.
  It has nothing on the supermarkets in the UK

### Cautionary Stories from Rio de Janeiro

For example, while a guy was passed out face down on the concrete floor in the park by a concrete bench,
another guy took his shoes off him to steal them and walk off along with his black bin bag of whatever else swag he
already had.
My big Nigerian friend noticed this and suggested we intervene so we walked across the park to intercept the thief.
My friend tells the thief very sternly to give those shoes back - a standoff ensues while the guy measures the two of us
up - before the local vagabond eventually backs down, and returns the shoes to the still unconscious man.

I ask a passing girl walking her dogs a few feet away from the still unconscious man
if it is normal to see people passed out like this in broad daylight,
and she says yes unfortunately and it's horrible and then scurries along.
Another local woman then walks over after the danger of the vagabond has passed as I'm trying to wake the man up, and
she rolls him slightly and places his the shoes under him so nobody else steals them.

We then go for a coconut drink across from the park
and as I walk 2 feet away from where we are sitting at the bar stools to put a straw wrapper in the bin,
a guy walks past and stares at my potentially unattended bag on the counter until he sees me walk back behind him before it can be swiped.

My friend has already had enough of the area within 5 minutes
because you can't even put your bag down to have a drink without worrying someone will immediately steal it,
as more homeless people patrol past.
We finish our drinks quickly and move on.

Another day,
a big muscular african american guy we meet at Copacabana beach, who has lived in Brazil for 2 years,
is walking with us while we're exchanging travel tips and going to get dinner together.
I tell him I'll write the name of a travel place I recommended on his phone when he struggles to understand the spelling
of the name, and he declines to take his phone out for fear of being mugged / it being snatched.
