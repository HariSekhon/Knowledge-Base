## Summary

Brazil is a country of great natural beauty but also stark wealth inequality and crime.

## Rio de Janeiro

A lot of places in Rio smell of urine, and there are a lot of homeless people asleep on the dirty streets.

### Taxi Apps in Rio de Janeiro

Taxis were hard to come by at times, possibly due to the Rio Carnival

- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/br/en/) - used Uber here, not InDrive, since there was no real price difference
- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/en-br)

### Rio Carnival

It is best to avoid carnival time as you'll be price gouged on accommodation costs.

### Tours in Rio de Janeiro

**Do not book tourst of Rio, it is a waste of money.**

My friend booked a one day tour of the city for $120 - this is a huge waste of money.

They just take people to a church,
which is free to enter, the Escadaria Selarón steps,
which is also a free attraction of a few colourful steps where tourists take photographs,
and then the main attraction, the big Christ the Redeemer statue, which is $16 per ticket, and a buffet lunch at a mere
4.1 rated restaurant (which doesn't include drinks or desserts) worth around $10.

Instead, you could just take a couple taxis for \$5 each, pay one entrance for \$16, get a better lunch and save yourself
at least \$70-\$80 out of the \$120 for the day's costs.

### Best Areas to Stay in Rio de Janeiro

- [Copacabana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5tmKCJLnZJnN8jLc9) -
  this is the primary neighbourhood for tourists in the South East of the city.
  It has the famous beach promenade as well as most of the well rated restaurants and better Zona Sul gentrified
  supermarkets

Not Recommended:

- Centro (smells)
- North West

### Restaurants in Rio de Janeiro

The guarana drink you see in many places in Brazi contains 35g of sugar, which is half your daily intake in a single
drink, so don't drink that.

- [Churrascaria Matinadas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Dn5RskppfszzNGua7) - popular affordable barbeque meats and buffet
  serf-service restaurant. They weigh the meat, so only take what you want, and put it on a separate plate so it is
  weighed separately

### Cautionary Stories from Rio

For example, while a guy was passed out face down on the concrete floor in the park by a concrete bench,
another guy took his shoes off him to steal them and walk off along with his black bin bag of whatever else swag he
already had.
My big Nigerian friend walks across the park to intercept and tells him very sternly to give those shoes back -
a standoff ensues - before the local vagabond eventually backs down, returns the shoes to the still unconscious man.

I ask a girl passer by walking her dogs past the still unconscious man if it is normal to see this,
and she says yes unfortunately and it's horrible and then scurries along.
Another local then walks over
after the danger has passed to put the shoes under the unconscious man so nobody else steals them.

We then go for a coconut drink across from the park
and as I walk 2 feet away from where we are sitting at the bar stools to put a straw wrapper in the bin,
a guy walks past and stares at my potentially unattended bag on the counter until he sees me walk back behind him before it can be swiped.

My friend has already had enough of the area within 5 minutes
because you can't even put your bag down to have a drink without worrying someone will immediately steal it,
as more homeless people patrol past.
We finish our drinks quickly and move on.

Another day,
a big muscular african american guy we meet at Copacabana beach, who has lived in Brazil for 2 years,
is walking with us while we're exchanging travel tips and going to get dinner together.
I tell him I'll write the name of a travel place I recommended on his phone when he struggles to understand the spelling
of the name, and he declines to take his phone out for fear of being mugged / it being snatched.
