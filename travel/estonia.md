# Estonia

The best of the three Baltic countries IMO, with prettier women and just generally feels slightly more developed.

## Tallinn

Tallinn, the capital, can be done in 2 days. There are plenty of good restaurants to visit.

- [Olde Hansa](https://www.oldehansa.ee/) - Medievil restaurant, highly recommended. It's expensive but worth it.
  It has live medieval music, the staff wear tunics, and the food is fit for royalty. You can even get bear on the menu
- [Sessel Speakeasy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eeedi9ZPgvYMSdGFA) - trendy bar above a book store with a view of the main
  street
- [Viru Lokaal](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RNdvDx8qSxHLKdUs9) - popular drinks venue on the main high street, open late
- [Lounge Deja Vu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/svuHeJZYqnpjQsc79) - popular cocktail bar
- [BWB Gastro Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ate8zc3np1hEHGgw8) - another popular bar next to Lounge Deja Vu
- [Depeche Mode Baar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xPtY6vaY4XxXYJvX9) - surprisingly cool bar playing Depeche Mode on a side
  street with trendy interior and some games machines
- [Villa Thai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qNo16NR5M37nBaD76) - good quality, but not cheap
