  and quieter streets, ideal for a more relaxed stay
- [Lastarria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UsisBHAWwF4ot92Y6) - bohemian cultural core with museums, cafes, galleries, and
  nightlife within walking distance of downtown
- [Bellavista](https://maps.app.goo.gl/786ApTnp84sDtEHw6) - vibrant and artistic quarter known for bars, restaurants,

  shops (mainly aimed at women), restaurants & cafes

<!--

[Hostal Providencia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oQ5k2c6yGkAJyQch7) the room upstairs is much nicer than downstairs due
to the skylight.
Wifi 2.5/0.3 Mbit/s but very unreliable

### Attractions in Santiago

- [Sky Costanera](https://maps.app.goo.gl/t6ReiMp7kDKRo6gL6)
- [Parque Bustamante](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oTev8xFi1KYTjtQZ6) - good sized city park with lots of trees,
  bike paths, exercise equipment, water feature, literay cafe and skate area
  - [Proyecto B](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bS9EQEbcLxTXUgLz8) /
    [Paralelas Parque Bustamante](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ey6xeysLyHusT5VB8) -
    free outdoor gym with pull up bars, dips bars and olympic rings - busy in the evenings
- [Mercado Condell](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gecVMLaznSga4QYw8) - boutique box park style small mall, very touristy /
  chick souvenir oriented

### Restaurants in Santiago

- [Zokai sushi & ceviche](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hYDr1Hk2Wvs2DEha7) - the triple ceviche is very filling -
  mixed one has Octopus, Shrimp and Salmon cubes.
  The Reina white fish ceviche is surprisingly good,
  and the shrimp ceviche is as expected with large prawns.
  Outdoor seating under canopies as well as indoor and upstairs seating.
  Wifi indoors only (untested)
- [Taquería TH](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LzJLVLeQQ9pWt8nPA) - open late until 11pm,
  the steak (vucano) burrito for 9000CLP ($10.50) is the best thing I've tried here.
  The tacos are decent - bistec / pollo / cameron (beef / chicken / shrimp) and are served with onions and a large wedge
  of lemon for each one as well as the usual green and red dips.
  At 3000CLP per taco ($3.50) I'm on the fence as to whether this is tourist priced.
  The chilaquiles for 9000 CLP while I scoffed it all,
  was not as good as I've had at other places primarily because the nachos themselves were a bit stale and not fresh,
  but overall I still stuffed my face and cleaned the plate.
  The small amount of seating is mainly outdoors on the pavement.
  No wifi
- [Yogurt Life](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UZnULdx8YgPhHuqb6) - 16 flavours of frozen yoghurt and sorbet with a counter
  full of fruits and dessert toppings,
  but it is priced by weight and racks up quickly, I blew 7700CLP ($9) on this before I knew it
- [Express de Lider Seminario](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5fX15SEDuU5Ruay79) - supermarket - literally one third the price
  of Oxxo convenience stores.
  I didn't realize what a rip off Oxxo is until I realized the same Glaceau Vitamin Water flavoured drinks for
  900CLP (\$1) here are selling for 2900CLP (\£3.40) in Oxxo, although they are by the counter and not refrigerated
- [Santa Isabel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8Ax76n7qN6m6BCeM6) - supermarket, much cheaper than Oxxo for drinks,
  but at 1100CLP (\$1.30) still not as cheap as my favourite Express de Lider Seminario supermarket above
- [Tottus Factoría](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6EW4Ge9rPnsfbQA59) - supermarket
- [Tienda koko](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4LxNVZe1E5oLECri9) - smaller grocery near
  [Parque Bustamante](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oTev8xFi1KYTjtQZ6) -
  only use this late night if Express de Lider Seminario is already closed (at 21:30), as it's eggs weren't as fresh

## Valparaíso & Viña del Mar

Two adjacent coastal cites west of Santiago approximately 7-10km apart.

They are about 2 hours away from Santiago by bus or 1.5 hours by car.

You can see both in a single day, the morning light is better for the street art in Valparaíso,
while the afternoon light is better for the beach at Viña del Mar so do the morning in the former and the afternoon in
the latter.

### Valparaíso

Historic bohemian port city, with street art, narrow winding roads, and steep hills with lots of stairs.

There are _"funiculars"_ - cable cars - which are both a solution to the steep hills and one of the attractions.

UNESCO world heritage site.

### Viña del Mar

Beach town, more modern.

### Travel to Valparaíso & Viña del Mar
