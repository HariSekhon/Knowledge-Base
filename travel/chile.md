## Summary

Uses the Chilean peso (CLP), which as of Feb 2026 is approximately just under 1,000 per 1 USD.

They also reuse the `$` symbol to mean CLP not USD in prices.

## ATMs in Chile

Do not use the Santander ATMs.

I made the mistake of withdrawing from one at a metro as I needed cash to buy a ticket and it charged me 8500CLP
($10) which is outrageous robbery as I could have taken an Uber across the city on card for not much more than that.

It probably would have been cheaper in fees to just exchange some cash at the airport Bureau De Change.

## Santiago

[Santiago](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F34UKX4iPVJqYztYA) is one of the more developed capitals in South America, with a
decent and cheap metro system.

### Taxi Apps

- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/en-cl) - much cheaper than Uber but cash only
- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/cl/en/r/cities/taxi/santiago-rm-cl/)

### Travel between Santiago Airport and Santiago Central

You can either take a Taxi App above or you can take a bus from immediately outside the arrivals exit.

Both the Centrobus or Turbus kiosks are next to each other and go to the Barrancas metro station.

Turbus is marginally cheaper and accepts card payments,
but get some cash before you get to the metro as the metro kiosks only accept cash and the ATMs there charge \$10!

At the Barrancas metro stop you can catch the green line to go the rest of the way into the city.

This is quite an easy public transport journey.

Turbus stops diagonally across the crossroad from the metro station.

You will need a Bip Card to use the metro or buses, a pre-paid card.

The Bip Card costs itself costs a one-time fee of 1500CLP (\$1.70) while each journey is just under 1000CLP per ticket
(\$1.15) per journey, and buses just under 500CLP (\$0.60), as of Feb 2026, so you should probably put at least 2000 CLP
on it to cover a couple journeys.

Unfortunately the metro human kiosks that dispense the Bip Cards only accept cash and the Santander ATMs inside the
metros are extremely expensive charging 8500CLP (\$10) in withdrawal fees - daylight robbery!

Next time I would just convert just enough cash for an InDrive or Metro at the exchange in the airport as it should be
cheaper than that and pay for everything else on card as Santiago is relatively very developed
compared to most of Latin America so nearly everywhere takes card.

### Best Areas to Stay in Santiago

- [Providencia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6CbKVdEoLF84oy2S7) - lively, well‑connected residential and commercial area with
  parks, restaurants, cafes, and easy metro access, great as a central base
- [Bellas Artes](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1FJDTnffVmQRNyVZ7) /
  [Lastarria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UsisBHAWwF4ot92Y6) - lots of gentrified cafes & restaurants,
  with museums & galleries, and nightlife
  [Santa Lucía Hill](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CH3hygHUmqGjt1Kd7) viewpoint
- [Bellavista](https://maps.app.goo.gl/786ApTnp84sDtEHw6) - vibrant and artistic quarter known for bars, restaurants,
  street art, and nightlife
- [Barrio Italia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AumFduiTh511TT2s6) - trendy, artsy neighborhood with lots of small boutique
  shops (mainly aimed at women), restaurants & cafes
- [Barrio Brasil](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UxmncZ8Ju3T4eNiYA) - west of the historic center, this areas has more graffiti
  and less top rated restaurants, I wouldn't recommend staying here as it's a big downgrade compared to the nicer areas
  above
- [Las Condes](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Xw7MiRJ1BrBmvncAA) - upscale suburb,
  better for longer stays than short stay tourists - modern district with quality dining, shopping,
  and quieter streets, ideal for a more relaxed stay

<!--

[Hostal Providencia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oQ5k2c6yGkAJyQch7) the room upstairs is much nicer than downstairs due
to the skylight.
Wifi 2.5/0.3 Mbit/s but very unreliable, painfully bad, makes browsing and booking next hop very slow sometimes,
stay somewhere else with better wifi next time

-->

### Attractions in Santiago

Santiago is a big city, with lots of attractions, museums and parks - I didn't even make it through all of these in the
4 days I was there (I spent a 5th day at Valpairaso & Vina Del Mar - the latter of which was worth it).

- Historic Center:
  - [Plaza de Armas de Santiago](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JuSrVV2tC2ZDUpbC6)

- [Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes](https://maps.app.goo.gl/meSBzNAPgj9VAcnq8) - national museum of fine arts
- [Sky Costanera](https://maps.app.goo.gl/t6ReiMp7kDKRo6gL6)
- [Parque Bustamante](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oTev8xFi1KYTjtQZ6) - good sized city park with lots of trees,
  bike paths, exercise equipment, water feature, literay cafe and skate area
  - [Proyecto B](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bS9EQEbcLxTXUgLz8) /
    [Paralelas Parque Bustamante](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ey6xeysLyHusT5VB8) -
    free outdoor gym with pull up bars, dips bars and olympic rings - busy in the evenings
- [Parque Metropolitano de Santiago](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NdFFUFeZCfYzKZ7s8) - TODO: didn't find time to make it up
  here, next time, should be a good view
  - [San Cristóbal Hill](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LZ3Nn6Zj8pgrCXz79)
  - [Observatorio Manuel Foster](https://maps.app.goo.gl/21qatWrQtULiqKXbA)
- [Parque Forestal](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oSzAMpDySgNAYkkZ6) - another large central park with historical monuments,
  adjacent to the national museum of fine arts
- [Parque Fluvial](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Kgf6o4aEC9r68MUW6)
- [Parque San Borja](https://maps.app.goo.gl/D6BoQDHDSV9V1mdZ9)
- [Cenco Costanera Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5cAyMMjHLKGUUMYW8) - large 6 story mall with huge food court on the
  top floor full as well as avenues of restaurants, with some outdoor terrace seating and vast indoor seating and
  dining options, as well as the usual international brand shops
- [Mercado Condell](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gecVMLaznSga4QYw8) - boutique box park style small mall, very touristy /
  chick souvenir oriented
- [Mall Vivo Imperio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jp5sQV6VyKdzLvzK7) - small mall but has a large kids soft play multi-story
  obstacle course on the basement level
- [Barrio Brasil](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hwhZKbLeSHviHo3e8) - low priority area, nowhere near as good as Barrio Italia:
  - [Plaza Brasil](https://maps.app.goo.gl/roHAyrFdkg3e4TpM8) - park popular with dog walkers and kids play area

### Restaurants in Santiago

- [Montana Gelato - Lastarria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Vvp6x7c7FJ6qVw7j7) - amazing ice cream, there is a reason there
  is always a queue out the door when I passed by.
  The pistacchio was the best I’ve had in ages,
  and the chocolate amargo (dark chocolate) was really good too, not too sweet.
  Even the waffle cone was perfect just the right amount of sweetness and wholesomeness -
  this place is ice cream excellence.
  It's not cheap at just over 5000 CLP for 2 scoops, as this is an expensive area,
  but it's also not as expensive as some of the surrounding places to get a snack like the Hansel & Gretal bakery,
  which I recanted on both times I intended to go looking at it's menu and estimated quality vs prices - I considered
  Montana the better option.
  Has both indoor and outdoor seating.
  I didn’t see a wifi network
- [Zokai sushi & ceviche](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hYDr1Hk2Wvs2DEha7) - the triple ceviche is very filling -
  mixed one has Octopus, Shrimp and Salmon cubes.
  The Reina white fish ceviche is surprisingly good,
  and the shrimp ceviche is as expected with large prawns.
  Outdoor seating under canopies as well as indoor and upstairs seating.
  Wifi indoors only (untested)
- [Taquería TH](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LzJLVLeQQ9pWt8nPA) - open late until 11pm,
  the steak (vucano) burrito for 9000CLP ($10.50) is the best thing I've tried here.
  The tacos are decent - bistec / pollo / cameron (beef / chicken / shrimp) and are served with onions and a large wedge
  of lemon for each one as well as the usual green and red dips.
  At 3000CLP per taco ($3.50) I'm on the fence as to whether this is tourist priced.
  The chilaquiles for 9000 CLP while I scoffed it all,
  was not as good as I've had at other places primarily because the nachos themselves were a bit stale and not fresh,
  but overall I still stuffed my face and cleaned the plate.
  The small amount of seating is mainly outdoors on the pavement.
  No wifi
- [Yogurt Life](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UZnULdx8YgPhHuqb6) - frozen yoghurt chain with 16 flavours of frozen yoghurt
  and sorbet, all self-service, and a self-service counter full of fruits and dessert toppings.
  Priced by weight and this racks up quickly... I blew 7700CLP ($9) on this before I knew it!
- [Yogen Früz](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qsNQSMTwLXa3XsyK9) - another frozen yoghurt chain, slightly cheaper than
  Yoghurt Life as it is fixed price by size, with 1, 2 or 3 fruits/toppings blended into it, and additional toppings
  charged
- [Oakberry Açai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dTVGweUtjvVzTRqq5) - the usual overpriced international acai chain
- [Express de Lider Seminario](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5fX15SEDuU5Ruay79) - supermarket - literally one third the price
  of Oxxo convenience stores.
  I didn't realize what a rip off Oxxo is until I realized the same Glaceau Vitamin Water flavoured drinks for
  900CLP (\$1) here are selling for 2900CLP (\£3.40) in Oxxo, although they are by the counter and not refrigerated
- [Express de Lider Merced](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1Chti4aC3VACb3fbA) - another one of these cheap centrally located
  supermarkets
- [Santa Isabel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8Ax76n7qN6m6BCeM6) - supermarket, much cheaper than Oxxo for drinks,
  but at 1100CLP (\$1.30) still not as cheap as my favourite Express de Lider Seminario supermarket above.
  Watch out for the cheap small bags of cookies at only 280-350 CLP (\$0.40), I fell for 2 bags of them!
- [Tottus Factoría](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6EW4Ge9rPnsfbQA59) - supermarket
- [Tienda koko](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4LxNVZe1E5oLECri9) - smaller grocery near
  [Parque Bustamante](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oTev8xFi1KYTjtQZ6) -
  only use this late night if Express de Lider Seminario is already closed (at 21:30), as it's eggs weren't as fresh

## Valparaíso & Viña del Mar

Two adjacent coastal cites west of Santiago approximately 7-10km apart.

They are about 2 hours away from Santiago by bus or 1.5 hours by car.

You can see both in a single day, the morning light is better for the street art in Valparaíso,
while the afternoon light is better for the beach at Viña del Mar so do the morning in the former and the afternoon in
the latter.

### Travel to Valparaíso / Viña del Mar

You can book a bus all the way online at:

- [Turbus](https://www.turbus.cl/)
- [PullmanBus](https://www.pullmanbus.cl/)
- [FlixBus](https://www.flixbus.cl/)

Since buses leave every 15-20 minutes I just turned up and bought a ticket on the next Turbus,
but if you're going at the weekends you might want to book online just to be safe.

### Valparaíso

Historic bohemian port city, with street art, narrow winding roads, and steep hills with lots of stairs.

UNESCO world heritage site.

There are _"funiculars"_ - cable cars - which are both a solution to the steep hills and one of the attractions.
They were charging 200CLP to locals and 1000CLP to foreigners for a ride.

I personally found Valparaíso to be very overrated and would skip it next time as there really isn't much that impressed
me here - a few colonial administrative buildings, some graffiti'd walls and the odd coffee shop and restaurant was not
worth the time, although you might want to allocate 2 hours to tick it off the first time you're in the area.

The architecture wasn't even that good, you'll find better in Santiago.

#### Attractions in Val

- [Cerro Alegre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1Pm8FyXcjw1DEpQ27) - hill area with colourful streets, graffiti and a few
  gentrified cafes & restaurants.
  Take a funicular up there unless you really want the exercise
- Funiculars:
  - [Ascensor Reina Victoria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/msTATjiEwh6fNVc99) - if you're walking from the bus terminal, this
    is the nearest one to ascend to the street arts hill area
  - [Ascensor Concepcion](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7LHmrjqZvV9SouKWA)
  - [Ascensor El Peral](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9Hx7Ey6ZWsuvRcXy9)
- [La Puerta Roja](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wHHMnST2SDCRLUNe6)
- [Cerro Concepción Valparaíso](https://maps.app.goo.gl/i7djZYXyGHA7jRs9A)
- [Escalera de Colores](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sUC847SseRsGAG1NA)
- [Baburizza Palace](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kKnffyWCXJaHdyEB8) - art museum
- [Museo de Historia Natural de Valparaíso](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xuvs7JppxpSU2d2D6) - if you're on a day trip,
  not sure you'd want to waste your time to this, get to Vina Del Mar instead
- [Muelle Prat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e1jL414BvabteMDa9) - docker where you can see the cargo ships or get a boat tour
  - there are a handful of souvenir shops, and also toilets for 500CLP entry - you'll need cash
- [Plaza Sotomayor](https://maps.app.goo.gl/k298QHEjLmVAwm6U7)
- [Monumento a Los Heroes de Iquique](https://maps.app.goo.gl/i1czGzfKkPfuzF8A7)
- [Plaza Echaurren](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vZy9HyMWv3bpRQei9)
- [Iglesia de la Matriz](https://maps.app.goo.gl/84t8UqAFynQ9YaUb7) - I walked across town to this,
  which looked great on the Google Maps pic but was underwhelming in real life
- [Terminal Rodoviario Valparaíso](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dNi3FZ6c6VoktxiK6) - the bus terminal where the bus drops you
  off. Some people catch a taxi from here but it's not a long walk along to the areas above and you get to see a bit
  of the city

### Travel from Valparaíso to Viña del Mar

Since they're a few km apart, it's not a practical use of time to try to walk it, you can either take a taxi, or just go
to the main coastal road where there are buses every few minutes going along the coast,
pretty much all of them should go to Vina Del Mar but check with the driver.

The bus only cost 500 CLP (\$0.60) and was quick and efficient.

### Viña del Mar

Beach town, more modern - this is where it's at, with a wide beach, pier, and many more well rated restaurants.

If you're on a day trip, prioritize spending most of your time here as it's much nicer than Valparaíso.

#### Attractions in Vina Del Mar

- [Vergara Pier](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zcwCQxYBExBNoUwb8) - pier with the main beach on either side of it
  - [Playa El Sol](Playa El Sol)
  - [Playa Acapulco](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rPri6YnpAfCzxeaB8)
- [Flower clock](https://maps.app.goo.gl/b26niXTyyHDR9chu5)

- [Plaza Colombia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EGguVQUv6WuNqqXh6)
- [Feria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FUCJELENTwMJGjEM7) - crafts & souvenirs market with a bit of food (hold off for
  better food places below)
- [Mall Marina](Mall Marina) - large mall with lots to eat and buy, 2 frozen yoghurt shops
  - [Yogurt Life](Yogurt Life) - same chain as in Santiago, see that section above for review
  - [Yogen Früz](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mVUBHwxjfNJv6UpZ7) - same chain as in Santiago
- [Las Salinas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iSVnwvsogZb4ZmsK8) - another beach a bit further north,
  I haven't been to this one yet
- [Playa Los Cañones](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kqFaAsnJtQjpnhEq8)
- [Playa de los Artistas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hiyTah9PZfyZAupq6)
- [Avenida Perú](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PmcQATtqtZ79brBu7)
- [Terminal de Buses De Viña Del Mar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rm4pEjiAFpsujQnp9) - catch the bus back to Santiago from
  here.
  This is the less nice end of town, but hey as long as it works...

#### Restaurants in Vina Del Mar

- [Cholos Restaurante](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kPZxXfxrUwPDB7S28) - good Peruvian restaurant.
  The traditional Peruvian lomo saltado of juicy steak strips with large onion slices, tomatoes, rice and fries is
  great, and is well worth the price and only takes 10-12 minutes to arrive if you're on the clock to catch the bus back
  to Santiago as I was! They also give 2 nice dips and 3 complimentary small yellow sweet bread buns which I really
  liked too.
