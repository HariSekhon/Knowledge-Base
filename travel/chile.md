## Valparaíso & Viña del Mar

Two adjacent coastal cites west of Santiago approximately 7-10km apart.

They are about 2 hours away from Santiago by bus or 1.5 hours by car.

You can see both in a single day, the morning light is better for the street art in Valparaíso,
while the afternoon light is better for the beach at Viña del Mar so do the morning in the former and the afternoon in
the latter.

### Valparaíso

Historic bohemian port city, with street art, narrow winding roads, and steep hills with lots of stairs.

UNESCO world heritage site.

### Viña del Mar

Beach town, more modern.
