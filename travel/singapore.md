# Singapore

This city state is one of the most developed places in Asia and one of the most expensive cities in the world.

This is another former British colony, like UAE, that has retained English speaking and UK 3-pin (type "G") plugs.

The food is more expensive and less good than the rest of Asia, and the hotels are expensive too.

Keep your visit short - 2-3 days should be enough to see the centre.

It's hard for me to give many recommendations here as I didn't stay long and wasn't impressed with the food at most
places (my friend who lived in Singapore for 10 years did warn me that the food there wasn't great).

- [Din Tai Fung](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6qjPc9t86kmGZRF78) - Taiwanese chain with a good array of noodle soups and
  dumplings (both savory and sweet, and mochi). The prawn & pork dumplings are good, you can have them as dumplings or
  as wontons in the spicy sesame sauce which is slightly spicey but not too much. It does not come as a soup, but as
  noodles in a base sauce with the dumplings, very yummmy
- [Poulet + Brasserie - ION Orchard](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ESLenpPGBj9GP3Pm6) - the quarter chicken with mash and
  french onion rice was good - think of it like a french Nandos without spice
- [Black Tap Craft Burgers & Beers](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f7kycwaSj1gj4rYw8) - same chain as in Dubai Mall, decent
  burgers at gentrified prices

I __don't__ recommend:

- [Collins](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RicdTvwnQSzVG1zE7) at Marina Square - wasn't impressed with the Wagyu steak.
  The fries were ok though, and the watermelon feta balsamic salad was good
- [Saizeriya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ibx8L9VYLS45mLaP8) - very low quality chain restaurant - it was the first place I
  tried in Singapore and was sorely disappointed - it's cheap but not worth wasting one of your day's meals on in my
  opinion. I found very little meat in the bolognese and the garlic focaccia was small and much less good than I'd
  imagined as that's a hard thing to get wrong. IMO it was the worst food I've eaten in Asia
