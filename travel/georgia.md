Georgia was too cold by October.

## Georgia Flights

Flights in and out of Georgia to the capital Tbilisi are a nightmare as it's hard to get a direct flight.
They often require stopover transfer flights in Turkey or other countries like Poland.

Flights in and out of the transfer cities are often delayed, causing you to miss your transfers
and end up stranded for 24 hours waiting for another flight to Tbilisi and having to take expensive hotels and rebook
flights at losses.

I missed my transfer flights both in and out of Tbilisi. This is probably one of the worst things about Georgia.

This is how I came up with the [Flights Gotchas section](#flights-gotchas).

## Tbilisi

### Taxis in Tbilisi

Do not use Airport taxis, they are double the price of using the Bolt app.

- [Bolt](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bolt-request-a-ride/id675033630) - used this was half the price of the official
  Airport taxi
- [Yandex Taxi](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yandex-go-taxi-food-delivery/id472650686)

### Tbilisi Airport

Tbilisi Airport wifi sucks.

It disconnects all the time and insists on giving a swipe right advertisement for investments before letting you
complete the networking setup.

Except you can't swipe on a laptop and pressing any combination of the right arrow and meta keys doesn't work.

So you can't connect your laptop to the airport wifi, only your phone.

### Restaurants in Tbilisi

Don't eat too many Khinkali dumplings, that's a lot of pastry, you'll end up getting a Stalin belly
(the infamous soviet leader Joseph Stalin was Georgian).

- [Chika](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ukVeBmmArPPczDGs7) - stylish gentrified cafe with good food and desserts too.
  The potato waffle with smoked salmon and poached on on top was a very good small plate meal in between meals.
  The Bumble coffee & orange juice mix was not my thing though.
  If you like chocolate try a Kartoshka little chocolate log dessert
- Santino - excellent 24x7 modcoffee bar - excellent drinks menu,
  good food menu, bit pricey by local standards but good ambience.
  They have _"Laptop Free Zone"_ stickers on every table (which I take exception to!) but it's quiet enough at night
  that it's not enforced.
  South just off Liberty Square a few doors closer to the square than
  [Bernard](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QG1TE4sq3LH7PXX89), not the Santino on Atoneli St that Google Maps finds which
  closes at 11pm.
- [Gloria Jean](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qKu3MUHQR5di9UpZ7) - good coffee shop in Liberty Square,
  the cherry juice is very nice, although the chai latte is a little too sweet IMO, ask them to add less powder
- [11:11 Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7kYuxEh4BPceUvev8) - good coffee spot but unfortunately always closes well before
  its Google Maps hours of midnight, often closed by 11pm.
  Gloria Jeans and Santino are far more reliable late night spots
- [Khinkali Bar N1](https://maps.app.goo.gl/D9igfusLuBNzkGue8) - affordable food place specializing in traditional
  Georgian dumplings called Khinkali
- [Salobie Bia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9UhPzRVDgBT1mfFi8) - affordable local eats place set in a large basement with
  impressive art decor all around with good ambience and background piano music.
  Menu is a bit limited on non-alcoholic drinks.
  Recommended to me by a local
- [Pasanauri](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MQCwW54s7MRHsoNs6) - moderately priced good food,
  the Khinkali mixed meat dumplings were very good and affordable, the aubergine walnut while a recommended speciality
  I found a bit much, you'd need two aubergine lovers to manage it.
  There are also a couple lovely dogs that hang around to eat scraps and occasionally bark as passers by,
  whom I can only assume they sense are evil...
- [Ode Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Xs4Vq6zcoXEn9KpK6) - live piano music at alfresco outdoor dining, more limited menu
  than Pasanuri and bit pricier (you're probably paying for the piano) but still good.
  The 10 Khinkali big meat dumplings and Kharcho soup are both good, but together are too much food.
- [Ramekai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NG1L1dCfpspMFB2u5) -
  Japanese sushi and ramen place if you want a break from Georgian food being soup and dumplings everywhere.
  Skip the deep fried popcorn chicken starter and go for the Miso Ramen.
