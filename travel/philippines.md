# Philippines

It's been too long since I've been to remember any particular restaurants,
but the restaurants I went to catered to mainly rich foreigners and were often empty.

It's very hot, and take mosquito repellent, you will need it.

The streets are overpopulated and wealth inequality is substantial,
which means a foreigner can live well with Western money.

Famed for its relatively more traditional women,
many men known as *"Passport Bros"* go to find something more resembling wives than even married men in the West have.

There are a lot of missing signs, apparently because locals take them down and melt them for the metal to get money.

## Manilla

In the capital, the malls were relatively sparse since a lot of the poorer locals were kept out by security.

Kidnappings of the children of the rich is also a problem, with gated communities having their own security forces.
