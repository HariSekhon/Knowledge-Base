### Travel from Buquebus Ferry

If coming from [Buenos Aires](argentina.md) via the ferry (1/3rd the price of plane) arriving
at [Terminal de Buquebus Montevideo], you can do one of the following:

- Taxi App - Uber quoted roughly 500 UYU (\$13)
- Take a bus for 64 UYU (\$1.70) quite easily to your final destination, consult Google Maps

### Taxi Apps in Montevideo

- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/uy/en/) - moderately priced, has a few cars on the map
- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/) - I didn't see cars on the map for this so it might not work

### Buses in Montevideo

Bus trips seems to cost 64 UYU (\$1.70) as of Feb 2026.

You need to get an STM prepaid travel card, which you can luckily pick up at one of these common convenience stores:

- [Abitab](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Abitab/) - they insisted on a national bank card for card payment or
  Uruguyuan Pesos cash - luckily there was also a Cambio money changer there to convert some dollars or euros
- [Redpagos](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Redpagos/)

The card itself is free although requires your passport for them to register the card to you,
and then you just top up some cash on the card.

### Restaurants in Montevideo

- [284 Burger House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XQsswtub1SB566Je8) - reasonable classic burger and crispy crinkle cut
  fries at mid price point - ok when you've just come out of the Buquebus Ferry and are hungry but I wouldn't go out of
  my way for it
