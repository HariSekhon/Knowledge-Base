## Summary

Just across the water from Buenos Aires, [Argentina](argentina.md),
they use the Uruguayan Peso (UYU / \$U), which as of Feb 2026 was \$U 38 per $1 or \$U 52 per £1.

## Montevideo

The capital. You don't need more than 2-3 days as it's not that big.

Montevideo is 2-3 degrees colder than Buenos Aires across the water and also has more wind chill,
making it feel several degrees colder than that,
likely due to it being more exposed to the open ocean compared to Buenos Aires which is set back from the ocean front.

### Travel from Buquebus Ferry

If coming from [Buenos Aires](argentina.md) via the ferry (1/3rd the price of plane) arriving
at [Terminal de Buquebus Montevideo], you can do one of the following:

- Taxi App - Uber quoted roughly $U 500 (\$13)
- Take a bus for $U 64 (\$1.70) quite easily to your final destination, consult Google Maps

### Taxi Apps in Montevideo

- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/uy/en/) - moderately priced, has a few cars on the map
- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/) - I didn't see cars on the map for this so it might not work

### Buses in Montevideo

Several bus lines go between east and west of the city making it easy to get around cheaply,
and the city is not that big anyway, just over a 1 hour walk if you wanted to.

Bus trips cost $U 52-64 (\$1.70) as of Feb 2026.

You need to get an STM prepaid travel card, which you can luckily pick up at one of these common convenience stores:

- [Abitab](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Abitab/) - they insisted on a national bank card for card payment or
  Uruguyuan Pesos cash - luckily there was also a Cambio money changer there to convert some dollars or euros
- [Redpagos](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Redpagos/)

The card itself is free although requires your passport for them to register the card to you,
and then you just top up some cash on the card.

I've found Google Maps planning of public transport route to be reliable here, even down to bus stops and arrival times.

### Attractions in Montevideo

There's not much in the way of attractions in Montevideo, but here are a few:

- [Rambla de Montevideo](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rambla+de+Montevideo) - long waterfront promenade with
  beaches where people like to walk, run, cycle, use free calisthenics and enjoy great sunset views
- [Ciudad Vieja](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z813fA2KYnn51b5J8) - historic old town with colonial architecture, museums,
  and cafes
- [Mercado del Puerto](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vXRx1ctNdduq8hXD7) - famous market with traditional parrillas and
  local food stalls
- [Plaza Independencia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/senH9xZU1YbCXLDNA) - main city square
  - [Palacio Salvo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3ghkuA4rxxuiSTEu5)

  - [Playa Pocitos - Bajada Buxareo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dBHBqkTPUL4iNx5r8) - beach
- [Punta Carretas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jUBLtpihhozWUZLs5)

### Restaurants in Montevideo

- [Lonely Star](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XkjdwtoUciv8U3sM6) - good menu, moderate prices. The chilequiles is smaller than
  ones in Mexico, and only comes with chicken or pork instead of beef like in Mexico. The tacos were very good quality,
  I had the beef and chicken ones - I’d stick with tacos over their chilequiles next time.
  The banana bonbom split was not big for its cost but it was tasty.
  Their drinks menu is mainly alcohols, and some lemonades, so little in the way of healthy drinks.
  Nice outdoor seating but fills up quickly, as this is one of the better drink spots in the area.
  It also has interior bar line seating, and tables, but my favourite is romantic orange downlit tables for two on the
  upstairs balcony.
  WiFi 12/17 Mbit/s
- [Francis](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PrQK6wZ94pNT5YRQ6) - probably one of the best restaurant in Montevideo - good menu
  and decor, excellent reviews, but expensive for Uruguay where a starter can cost you \$20 and a main \$30
  (Feb 2026 prices).
  Because it's expensive you will see more rich old people eating here (urgh).
  They brought a starter of breads with garlic butter (needed more garlic) and duck liver pate on chutney
  (surprisingly good combination even though I usually never like pate or support how it is made).
  Their gnocchi was surprisingly good, fattening, but this is not the play to diet.
  Their lasagna and duck confit are also recommended, I would try the duck if I were to go again.
  The Crocante De Almendras dessert was ok, but for \$12 I'd skip it next time as I've had better desserts.
  WiFi 87/42 Mbit/s
- [284 Burger House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XQsswtub1SB566Je8) - reasonable classic burger and crispy crinkle cut
  fries at mid price point - ok when you've just come out of the Buquebus Ferry and are hungry but I wouldn't go out of
  my way for it
- [Frog](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Frog+supermarket+montevideo/) - mini-market convenience store chain
- [Tata](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Tata+supermarket+montevideo/) - mid-sized supermarket chain across the city
