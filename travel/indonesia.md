## Bali

$35 visa on arrival.

Much more developed than expected, gentrified, full of Western restaurants and coffee shops.
Humid and hot, with a beach and bars busy even late on a Sunday night.

Watch out for restaurants - most of them add 15-17% to your bill for VAT and service.

It rains a lot here, though - it makes the UK look like drizzle country.
Bring your best umbrella, and flip flops because your trainers will get soaked whereas flip flops dry out faster.

### Canguu

Surf town, more young attractive people and digital nomads.

- [Blacklist Coffee Roasters](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wSHe5knuDZCHAKxV6) - Fast wifi 30-70Mbit, split into two areas,
  area to the left back when you walk in is full of people on laptops and has plugs. Full breakfast is decent,
  as is the crispy proscuitto & eggs on sourdough toast, and a good range of drinks
- [Canteen Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/W5tY3thHoQVsb2Ww5) - good food, reasonable prices, 170Mbit/s wifi and plugs.
  My pick here is the breakfast deal 1: 2 eggs & bacon on sourdough toast, fruit bowl and juice for only ~$7
- [Nalu Ice Cream](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vXDgJsAhNGkeyCJ18) - ice cream, milkshakes made from ice cream + milk.
  165Mbit/s WiFi
- [Tucker - Sandwich & Cocktail Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bwHqw3z3KTDeXkXo8) - quiet during the day, 200Mbit download
  / 100Mbit upload WiFi, good menu and reasonable prices. The Med breakfast with an extra egg and sourdough toast is my
  pick here
- [Two Face / Coffee & Brunch](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1H5cTp9PLKti1DTk7) - good menu for both food and drinks,
  reasonable prices and 80Mbit/s wifi.
  The downside is it closes early at only 4pm.
  One of the 60k specials or the big breakie are my picks here.
- [Milk & Madu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5E6Q149PQEN6jVUw9) - Decent menu, moderate prices, has milkshakes and juice
  mixes. Pasta Club Friday 5pm onwards only 65,000 ($4) for any pasta dish such as bolognese or lasagna.
  Wifi has no password but it's slow 17Mbit/s download / 2Mbit/s upload
- [Pizza Fabbrica - Canggu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/w6dQ5QMLbBqxePAV6) - Italian pizza, huge coconut, 45 Mbit/s download
  / 10Mbit/s upload wifi

### Kuta

More touristy, older crowd, lots more accommodation, so cheaper than Canguu.

"Kuta is not the vibe" my Bali nomad friend said.

- [Warung Damar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7RTmd7uHF56CQ8Mw8) - Indonesian, good menu, reasonable prices. Rendang curry is
  so popular here that sold out by 8pm! 28Mbit download / 13Mbits upload wifi
- [Crumb & Coaster](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TAjjMdkKN97DF9ed7) - hip coffee/juice brunch restaurant with nice ambience
  and 20-30Mbit/s wifi
- [Edgy Chef & Barista](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ENgKwjSo9DVa4H8d7) - good English breakfast with bacon medallions and
  good sausage, the garlic avocado side was a nice touch too. Has milkshakes, but juices are slightly above average
  price. Stunning 270Mbit/s up & down wifi
- [Dulang Kafe Kuta Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5ymrHvfSV3YCiXWs9) -
  good menu, ambience, reasonable prices, juice mixes, smoothies, asian and italian food,
  45Mbit download but only 6Mbit upload wifi
- [BS Kitchen Kuta](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LyUaEzyEzQNFgvBA9) - breakfast eggs and bacon including tea/coffee/juice for
  a mere ~\$4.
  The balinese chicken curry is very good and only \$3 - could have been bigger though.
  Had a side of fries as a top up, which also could have been bigger.
  60Mbit/s download / 30Mbits upload wifi
- [AMV Shooting & Sport Bar 88](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RT8Uao6384jJr8CS8) - live American rock music every night, they
  have talent. Crinkle fries come hot and crispy, very good snack, menu and prices are reasonable. WiFi is a bit slow
  at 7Mbit down / 5Mbit upload but you don’t come here the WiFi
- [Avera](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SMDFJfWvkzFBj1qx8) - good venue with bar view of the street, and live music every night
  (the music is much better in AMV Shooting & Sport Bar 88 above). Avoid their orange juice it's pre-made full of sugar.
  Food kitchen open until 2:45am, which is rare in Bali. Their seafood spaghetti is good
  Wifi is 30Mbit/s download / 15Mbit/s upload but requires a captcha portal password
- [Ground Zero Kitchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bBaxcnx1AckzCrTs9) - better juice menu than Avera across the street,
  venue is a bit smaller, also with live music, \$5 bolognese is cheaper than Avera across the road, but too salty.
  Wifi is also slow 3Mbit/s download, 13Mbit/s upload
- [Happy Sports Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/g4v3Y71bCZxvMzyj7) - decent menu prices, UFC or Boxing on TV and free pool
  table. Bolognese was better than expected, slightly sweet, and very affordable at around $4
- [Don Juan Mexican Restaurant and Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LtZnHqk4sxy83YbXA) - reasonable burrito and price
- [See You Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/57aZzfXRdcRiEwoc7) - lovely gentrified cafe on an inter-connecting alley way.
  You'd need to know it's there to find it.
  Good menu, reasonable prices, glass straws, their anti-age juice is nice, as is their English breakfast.
  Their regular wifi tested at only 18Mbits/s download and 2Mbit/s upload on my phone but 65Mbit/s download and 35Mbit/s
  upload on my Mac, while their 5G wifi was 100Mbit/s download / 90Mbit/s
- [The Alleys Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nw6UFHF26SveQAYr6) - good menu and prices, 60Mbit/s wifi. The fish & chips
  is a fairly modest meal of only 2 pieces of battered fish and a moderate portion of french fries, but this leaves
  space for dessert and the caramelized banana split is excellent, with a thin layer of caramelization on each banana
  half and one scoop of chocolate and one scoop of vanilla ice cream
- [Chill Coffee Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XnqADiUfMdYAzvBS9) - small coffee shop with acai bowl, smoothies, and
  pastries, not much in the way of substantial food, but impressive 200Mbit/s wifi

### Seminyak

You can find places to eat on the beach for the view,
but their ratings aren't as good, so you might want to eat one place and just enjoy drinks on the beach instead.

- [Hibiscus Restaurant Seminyak](https://maps.app.goo.gl/P4Cf1GPwjmj7A65C9) - good quality food with excellent
  presentation, such as the chicken coconut soup and probably the beef rendang curry I've had in Bali with large tender
  high quality beef pieces, but the wifi is capture portal and very slow under 1Mbit/s
- [The Shisha House Seminyak](https://maps.app.goo.gl/adSpuYqKunfSKpbu8) - good food such as chicken skewers and fries,
  reasonable prices, larger seating upstairs with private garden. The English breakfast includes a drink and fruit bowl
  too. Wifi speed is excellent at 130Mbit/s bi-directional
- [Sisterfields](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LqZRPVAMnR7m7ddt5) - full breaky was good, although no sausage, acai bowl was
  very good, lots of fruit, nuts and berries. Prices were higher than on website, 60/8Mbit wifi but capture portal,
  didn't work on laptop, no pop-up (perhaps pop-up blocker), only phone. I hate capture portals
- [Mykonos Greek Restaurant Bali](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2AYMEahpGMpj4pEC7) - ignore the Google rating on this one, the
  chicken garlic shawarma and crispy fries for £6 with excellent tomato salsa dip containing garlic, onion and parsley.
  130/9 Mbit wifi
- [Pallas Greek Taverna](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WRSjJrqXQQ4jZtz5A) - chicken souvlaki (skewers) with fries, pitta and
  tzatziki dip are decent, although
- [Dua Sisi Kitchen & Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zxPb6bcUTADfLSPG7) - meatball fettucini was decent, but slow
  15/3Mbit wifi
- [Oakberry Acai Seminyak](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4DpryxqRoLbCB19k7) - tasty, lots of fruit topics throughout,
  54Mbit wifi and plugs
- [Yogurt Republic Seminyak](https://maps.app.goo.gl/j8gxrbfZvSqvXR299) - the frozen yoghurt by weight is really good -
  the black charcoal coconut is the most novel flavour, with the green apple and mango flavours as my joint second
  picks here. It also has acai bowls, a little cheaper than Oakberry, decent but nowhere as much fruit as Oakberry
- [Bossman](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6hDtk7w1ohfBSxPo9) - small but busy burger joint, not cheap, 28/28 Mbit wifi

### Ubud

Of [Eat, Love, Pray](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0879870/) movie fame.

Several places are closed on Fridays and Saturdays.

- [Pilleyar bar & kitchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xXxL9sEBiXLzVUXJ8) - affordable tenderloin surf n turf, good juice
  and smoothie menu, has milkshakes, live music salsa dancing for free every Monday and Thursday.
  94Mbit wifi both directions
- [Tucky | Specialty Coffee & Brunch](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dnCTPd9ZNkv2R5s36) - busy early in day sold out of juices
  and lamb shoulder by 1pm, 9am-4pm, reopens at 4pm as a wine bar. Impressive 170Mbit/s wifi bi-directional
- [Rococo Warung](https://maps.app.goo.gl/H5sJCbQJStNGiC4g6) - very good prices, breakfast all day, 48/25Mbit WiFi
- [Kismet Bar & Kitchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nnHPVfWDp2kbeMjt7) - good venue, menu and prices, brunch menu until
  4pm. 38-48Mbit/s wifi
- [Baba Bistro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UkNLrGmos1LJq7f26) - Mediterranean good food, juices are a bit small, moderately
  pricey, street view seating. The Mediterranean Beef Bowl with Wagyu beef, salad, humous and pita is very good.
  I needed a bit more food so added the chimicurri beef taco which was also really good. 30/19 Mbit/s wifi
- [Brasserie at Alaya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bS3pfvKrXwWufu8A9) - upmarket hotel restaurant, decent menu
- [First Cafe Ubud](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sZh3aRgq4kdG2Gk86) - 100Mbit WiFi, reasonable prices, bit quiet though
