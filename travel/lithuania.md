# Lithuania

Lithuania is noticeably poorer than Poland.

There is a common Georgian restaurant chain called Chačapuri which is well worth a visit for their traditional soup.

## Vilnius

Vilnius, the capital, is worth a visit but you don't really need more than a couple days as it's not that big.

- [Chačapuri](https://www.facebook.com/GeorgianBakery/) - Georgian chain restaurant with an excellent traditional Georgian soup with beef and vegetables with
  a bit of spice. Another traditional dish Khachapuri is basically a similar to a pizza but with more dough around the
  edges - a bit bready for my liking but something you may want to try once
