## Summary

This former British colony has good English and like [UAE](#uae) even English three socket plugs.

April - July is best as the weather is cooler for outdoor travel.

Avoid December - February due to heavy rains.

## Taxis in Malaysia

Take the train to Kuala Lumpur before midnight otherwise you will get
price gauged on taxis as Grab had no drivers left available.

- [Grab](https://www.grab.com/) - the main taxi app in Kuala Lumpur, has its own area opposite the airport entrance

## Kuala Lumpur

### Bukit Bintag

[Bukit Bintang](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Y96hjBXuxg9XaC216) is the best area to stay overall, with lots of restaurants,
the [Jalan Alor Food Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rqoK5MNxcRCR2oh8A) night market,
the luxury [Pavillion](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xLQ4FKexh3jNDv1D7) shopping center,
the bar street [Changkat Bukit Bintang](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KZMNXSDVS3gmTDHb9),
and affordable hotels.

- [Jalan Alor Food Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rqoK5MNxcRCR2oh8A) - night market full of food stalls and
  restaurants. Some of the restaurants can be a bit of a tourist trap though
- [Pavilion](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xLQ4FKexh3jNDv1D7) - fancy luxury brands mall with eateries around it
- [Damascus](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AQpz9GEUePHgQMoL8) - very popular, good food, good prices, lots of seating on
  multiple floors, open late.
  Fattoush salad was good and cheaper than surrounding restaurants.
  The chicken curry with mandi rice was good, and the Adani tea was so good I had two,
  and I don't usually even drink tea - sweet with cardamom and nutmeg.
  39/20 wifi on level 1, 270/240Mbit wifi on level 2, amazing!
- [Zhang LaLa Mee Tarik](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JHuC3KYRaF4XMRnE6) - popular ramen foodie restaurant with hand pulled
  noodles of perfect firmness, and very affordable.
  Braised beef soup comes with beef cubes, while the normal beef soup comes with thin flat beef strips, which I find are
  actually slightly easier to eat.
  Both are around £3 plus you can get an extra portion of free noodles with it.
  The hau gau prawn chinese dim sum dumplings were good and cheap at only £1.50.
  They sold out on my second visit so I tried the traditional siew mai dumplings but wasn't as keen on them.
  The 12 fried dumplings for $3 are good and with a nice slightly spicey dip, well worth it.
  Orange and Apple juices are good, coming in large glass mugs for £1 (remember to ask for it with no added sugar).
  Service was slow though, but that's because you're supposed to order online.
  Food delivery was fast once ordered online though.
  The only negative was the wifi was extremely slow at 1Mbit download and 0.16Mbit upload it didn't work properly.
  Good foodie place though. My midnight dumplings snack place
- [Arab Hadramot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LHzcnyuYvE99of186) - good fattoush, the chicken cubes wrap is a bit small, but
  the few fries with it were very crispy and fluffy.
  The grape leaves starter in lemon juice is good too.
  Kitchen is open late until 1:30am, wifi is super fast at 360/130Mbit - amazing!
- [Restoran Ali Food Corner](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NAKybRsQNnHnLXSt5) - decent 24 hour cheap late night indian
  restaurant with large selection of food and fresh juices. Garlic naan is good and comes with 3 dips, and the lamb
  curry is also good with large pieces of meat
- [Luna Luna - Berjaya Times Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UCy75kFPbEghZMC1A) - the spicy buttermilk percik grilled
  chicken with rice and sambal potatos is good, add an egg for extra protein. The lychee lemonade is good if you have a
  sweet tooth. All in cost only me around £6. The wifi was broken though
- [Hometown Hainan Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zVA3MfzJtdktRhNA7) - tasty juices with honey and
  cheese & ham croissant with scrambled eggs. 22/8Mbit wifi
- [Kafe Dolce](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jkjp614kAKS32Mjs6) - coffee shop with toasties outside the Lalaport mall near the
  link bridge. Fast 37/27Mbit wifi

### Chinatown

[Chinatown](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9JuMioce8MazLrfE6) is the best area in Kuala Lumpur for budget travelers,
the opposite of Bangkok.
It has plenty of restaurants as well as the [Petaling Street Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Gh1LkbUYu4uD8mie9) and the
[Central Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qcQPb5B6QC8sQbju9).

The Jalan Sultan road on the east side of the Petaling Market is better for late night eating,
and particularly the south part of that road.

The [Jalan Petaling](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CW7rrVZk1uHDDmY66) road on the south of the Petaling market has a few bars,
but nothing as busy as [Changkat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KZMNXSDVS3gmTDHb9) in Bukit Bintang.

- [Petaling Street Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Hs2cKZrZZC31htt8) - stalls of clothes, handbags and electronics in
  Chinatown surrounded by small Chinese restaurants. Haggle and ye shall receive
- [Central Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iqMaQ7appKxnSLdJ7) - indoor boutiques, arts and crafts, a small food court,
  worth a browse, with street food and jewellery stalls along the west outside
- [UpperDeck KL](https://maps.app.goo.gl/k4VqFiUPe6ezZFhG8) - good menu, try to get there for lunch when the prices of
  the same dishes are 2/3rd on the lunch menu
- [Taste of Medan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dc5ZexF2Ve6iHye48) - Indonesian at Central Market Annexe, decent food and
  prices - the beef rendang platter was good and filling for ~£4, and the honey lemon drink is good for those with a
  slightly tweet tooth. Unfotunately the passionfruit sour plum drink was sold out. Next time
- [The Lankan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2GdLE1WS3Wh9xzJ9A) - Sri Lankan, reasonably priced, fast wifi 21/11 using the
  2.4Ghz on phone, 300/180 using the 5Ghz network on laptop.
  The chicken curry with biryani rice was good in both taste and portion size
- [Mee Tarik Restoran](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FbHCnG5ra48RjAbk7) - same chain as in Bukit Bintang above, affordable,
  decent food. My midnight dumplings snack place
- [Nam Heong Chicken Rice](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4z8KxHqZJEd5RutW8) - forget the Google star rating, this place is
  full of asians eating here for a reason. Good food, reasonable prices.
  The mutton curry noodles are very good, I just wish the portion size was bigger.
  The noodles are made in house, and the curry sauce was very good too, although mutton is a bit fatty.
  You can get beef rendang noodles, or with rice. The chicken BBQ buns are very good, fluffy and sweet too

### Private Healthcare in Kuala Lumpur

Malaysia is known for good quality affordable private healthcare.

I have personally used the affordable private hospital Sunway for full health screenings for a mere £280 -
a tiny fraction of the cost of wasted taxes in legacy Western socialist democracies where you don't get treated
(looking at you UK NHS).
