## Car Rentals in Italy

I haven't used these, my colleagues were discussing them:

- [TinLeggio](https://www.tinoleggio.it/)
- [LocAutoRent](https://www.locautorent.com/en/)

## Rome

Been a long time, there are Gelato ice cream places everywhere.

## Venice

Steps everywhere, do not go with children and especially not with a buggy. You will spend all day carrying the buggy up
and down steps, which is hardly a holiday.

Somewhat expensive, don't go for more than a long weekend.

Also, got caught in a storm just before leaving, check the weather forecasts.
