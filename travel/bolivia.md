## Summary

Bolivia is a very 3rd world country, I struggle to find a reason to spend time and money visiting it.

The salt flats dessert in Uyuni is probably the only thing you might want to see once in your life for a 1 day trip.

I used Saily e-sim in Bolivia as it was the cheapest I could find at the time,
but be sure to check all the [Mobile e-Sim providers](../travel.md#mobile-e-sims)
I list in the travel overview page as prices can change.

## Currency Issue

Bolivia uses the Boliviano (BOB).
Exchange rate on of Jan 2026 is artificially pegged by the Bolivian government to roughly 7 BOB per \$1 and
9 BOB per £1, but the actual market rate is far more BOB per dollar or GBP.

There is a big problem with the official rate being far lower number of BOB
than you would get on a real market exchange rate,
meaning you should not use ATMs or Card payments
as the banks will scam you for 70% more foreign currency than if you just converted foreign cash to BOB on the
free market.

Bring CASH (USD, EUR, GBP) to convert at exchanges instead of using cards and ATMs.

My host recommended I check the exchanges [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AH5d64d6SPfd57bj9) since there are several,
but I found they were all pegging USD to 6.96 BOB everywhere and the only variation was on GBP, Peruvian SOL and EUR.

I dumped my Peruvian Sol at an exchange rate of 2.8 BOB
and converted Euros at 11 BOB as that was the best relative exchange rate out of my 3 reserve currencies of USD, GBP and
EUR.

For dollars, I found [MoneyBox](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iAP5RAWYYjPErCcaA) was offering 9.50 BOB per USD, but they
don't take Euros or British Pounds at all.
Note there is no sign above this little shop unit.

## La Paz

[La Paz](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QD32tMLounS5s5Vz5) looks exactly how you'd expect a 3rd world country to look.

This is probably one of the worst capitals I've seen in the world,
which is saying a lot considering I've travelled to over 50 countries at this point, many of them multiple times.

The restaurant scene cannot hold a candle to neighbouring [Peru](peru.md).

La Paz is also the highest administrative capital in the world at 3500m above sea level,
so you will tire quickly going uphill.

Within 2 hours of walking around the Sopacachi and Centro areas I have no plans to visit La Paz again.

I had heard a couple guys in Cusco complaining they spent a week here and wishing they hadn't wasted more than 2 days.

I would say 1 day stopover and then move on.

### El Alto Airport

The airport is very small and the domestic departure lounge to Uyuni (for visiting the salt flats) has 3 cafes,
one of which was closed at 7am, and a couple souvenir shops.
There was not much to eat.

### Best Areas to Stay in La Paz

Don't stay in La Paz, transit through and go somewhere nice instead, but if you have to stay 1-2 nights for flights:

- [Sopocachi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/x57fBhFJv9syfj5UA) - good all-round area, central, walkable, good cafes,
  restaurants, bars, and easy access to the Mi Teleferico
- [Centro Histórico](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UBrv8Xgfx2FJUbYp8) - close to Plaza Murillo, good for sightseeing, but busy
  and noisy at night
- [Miraflores](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1hEXCaajebHANiG96) - green parks suburb close to the centre
- [Zona Sur (Calacoto & San Miguel)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uLQsS6s3a2476KPc6) - far out suburb, quieter, greener, and
  more modern. Slightly lower altitude, good for acclimatizing, with upscale dining and shopping. Less touristy, more
  residential

<!--

[Greenhouse](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZxwFGGKmbXfxeTut8) was pretty basic, the fridge gets locked and the taps only have
cold water, which is horrible for shaving.
The front gate cannot be opened from inside, there are electric release buttons at the reception desk and kitchen.
Do not stay here again.
Wifi 202/34 Mbit/s

[Lobo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pRXwxaABxn8BTTNm9) - the en-suite tap had only cold water and there was virtually no
hot water because the water pressure on the hot water tap was too low pressure for it to come out.
Do not stay here again.
Wifi varied 2/3 Mbit/s to 54/3 Mbit/s but several of its 4-5 networks are unreliable

-->

### Taxi Apps in La Paz

- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/) - my favourite, usually half the price of Uber but cash only
- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) - since I didn't have any BOB cash I took an Uber for 42 BOB (\$6) but found the driver
  charged me 90 BOB instead by taking the long way.
  I had to challenge this in the Uber app.
  You're already paying the worst exchange rate by using card payment
  rather than converting to market rate cash as per the [Currency Issue](#currency-issue) section above.
  On the way back to the airport the other Uber driver did it too,
  too the long way saying it was faster and then charging 92BOB instead of 43 BOB shown on the app.
  Uber originally declined to fix it and it had to be escalated to support.
  I would avoid using Uber next time
  and try to stick with InDrive as it is harder for them to change the price on you when you are holding cash,
  especially if you have small notes for the right amount

### Attractions in La Paz

I am really struggling to make this section as this is not a tourist destination.

- [Plaza Mayor de San Francisco](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7aT5SoToxky28ueh7)
- [Plaza Murillo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qRzPnRrBW3Dapjch6)
- [Sagarnaga](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ed5VRPfKrAaDBVNs7) - tourist shops street
- [The Witches Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8DbmA3dwK8kjAbYx8)

### Restaurants in La Paz

- [Biofilia Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VNjTY3vQjsy7mwnP8) - the most gentrified coffee shop I’ve seen in La Paz
  with an excellent menu of both drinks and desserts -
  there are 3 dessert sections,
  one of which is a Biofit healthy option with gluten free and sugar alternatives like date syrup and stevia.
  Must visit.
  The Acai Latte was decent.
  The classic bruschetta was one large toast with lots of tomatoes, it was good although could use more garlic and
  onion.
  The Pistachio & Matcha Mousse is their most popular dessert but it was sold out.
  The Bunuelos Biofilia with home made api was good though, just the right amount of sweetness, although I wish it was
  bigger.
  The Copoazu Lassi was really good, just the right amount of sweetness too, a local twist on an indian idea.
  I could eat here all day, the place is actually vegetarian and vegan but I didn't notice until later on because the
  menu was so good.
  They also have acai bowl and tropical fruit bowl.
  I wish I had more time to eat my way through their menu as this was the highlight of La Paz.
  I went back for a second visit to try their Pistachio & Matcha Mousse dessert but found it disappointing, although
  I enjoyed the bruchetta again and tried the
  WiFi 25/33 Mbit/s
- [Beef & Beer](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nKqkXhhhbZqMHv7w8) - the Beef&Beer Sirloin steak was great, covered in fried
  onions and red peppers, with good fries and a side salad.
  The pineapple with ice cream and dulce de leche was good too
  I was very satisfied with the food here.
  Has wifi
- [La Rufina Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1gqKQai727rwRjmr8) - upmarket restaurant at moderate price.
  The Cole de Res was quite good - shredded oxtail in a demi-glaze sauce, with yuca puree
  (similar to mashed potato made from mashed casava), sauteed vegetables and a smoky chimichurri sauce.
  It's portion size was medium only so if you're very hungry you might be left wanting more
  (I'd just had 3 courses at Biofilia so I was grateful for the reprieve).
  The Mocochinchi drink made from peach was surprisingly nice, not too sweet,
  with a half dehydrated peach in the glass too.
  Has wifi
- [Inti Restaurant Café Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WkqWwAB6PdbWiggX7) - the paiche prehistoric fish ceviche was red
  not white fish.
  I had to ask if they'd given me the right thing.
  The ceviche itself was ok, nice and limey with onion and a few crispy wafers.
  Next time I'd probably go with a burger instead.
  The juice had sugar in it, apparently that's what they call natural in Bolivia.
  Ask specifically for no sugar.
  WiFi was full signal but intermittent traffic, unusable
- [Hipermaxi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Y13xM4XfvMDgNPca8) - supermarket

Not Recommended:

- [Sushi Udon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eXBTaukpN6SHBhnS8) - cheap but not worth it at all -
  I have no idea how this place could possibly receive a 4.8 rating,
  it is not authentic or even good quality.
  The udon is not authentic, it's just spaghetti, and the sushi is just rice with whatever ingredients.
  Don't waste one of your meals on this place,
  I wish I'd gone to La Rufina instead of taking a punt on this one based on its undeservedly high rating.
  Doesn't have wifi

## Uyuni

[Uyuni](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fAbtQgzw4HNeFRFp9) is even worse than La Paz, it barely has gravel roads as of Jan 2026,
which were flooded all over town making it hard to cross streets.

After 55 countries I have never seen such a 3rd world place.

People travel here only to see the salt flats desert, described in [The Salt Flats](#the-salt-flats-tour) section below.

### Uyuni Airport

It's very small but functions.

Uyuni such a one horse town that there is only 1 flight a day in or out in the early mornings
(I think it's the same plane), and looking out the window there is nothing but dessert and mountains in the distance.

There is an open wifi network `@Ruijie-sD67E` as of Jan 2026.

There is 1 cafe before security on the upper level but they did not have the American Breakfast from the menu,
only the vegetarian or quick breakfast sandwich.

It's mainly a coffee stop but they do have good seating and power sockets for your phone or laptop.

Their chai tea is unfortunately just a black tea without milk, not a chai latte,
which is obvious in hindsight but I was sleepwalking at 7:50am to catch the only available flight out,
and there is no chai latte option on the menu.

There is a downstairs toilet and an upstairs toilet next to the cafe,
but it has a single cubile that doesn't flush properly and there was no running water in the tap,
just a jug with water next to the sink - I wasn't joking when I called this place 3rd world - but at least there is a
soap dispenser!

### Taxis in Uyuni

Neither Uber nor InDrive worked for me in Uyuni.

Uber had absolutely nothing and InDrive had only 2 drivers that ignored my request, even when I raised it to 25 BOB.

I ended up taking an airport taxi, usually a last resort, after fixing the price to 20 BOB up front.

### The Salt Flats Tour

The salt flats dessert tour is a 1 day tour.
The average price was around 300bs for the 1 day tour (\$40), although others in my group paid 500bs because they didn't
check the prices with the other tour operators.
The 2 day tours were much more expensive at 800-1400bs (\$115-\$200) with various tour operators.

The 2 and 3 day tours visit other places,
but the 1 day tour was quite tiring as it was, arriving back at around 8:20pm,
so everyone in my group was glad we didn't commit to a 2-3 day long tour.

Go to the toilet at the Colchani market (second stop, after the train cemetery) as it's worse later on at the
salt sculptures, and in between then during the lunch on the salt flats there is nowhere to go there.

The salt sculptures location is an extra 20bs entrance fee not included with any tour.

There is also a maze at the salt sculptures, which will likely take you 20 minutes to find your way in and
out of.

I do not recommend the toilets at the salt scultures unless you really need to - they are horrid,
they don't flush and absolutely stink from the waste that doesn't disappear -
there is just a guy who just scoops and pours one jug of water from a big water tub after each person goes,
and there is no running water in the tap either.
Trying to scoop some water from the tub next to the sink feels like it makes your hand dirtier or feel weird,
it seems to be that diluted blue sanitizing water.

If you can I'd wait for the toilet at the last stop where they have a coffee shop that should be better -
it can't possibly be any worse than the toilets at the salt scultures!

### Restaurants in Uyuni

<!--

[Piedra Blanca Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DrShnMTTrcUcRnvx9) is on the southwest edge of town,
about 10-15 minutes walk. Has hot water all day including the taps for shaving. Includes breakfast
with scrambled eggs, juice, cereal and watermelon. Quite good overall.
Wifi 38/22 Mbit/s

-->

- [Llama Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oKFPxdX3pCcD2ABQ6) - gentrified cafe. The bruschetta was good with lots of fresh
  tomato on it, and the porridge with fruits was good too (mango, banana and strawberry).
  Has wifi
- [Memos Coffee Bistro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dB9irZjQMLARsQtm8) - I came for the acai bowl but they didn't have it.
  I tried the granola bowl instead and that was very good, up to gentrified coffee shop standards, yoghurt topped with
  a row of strawberry and banana slices, blueberries, a couple dried orange slices, syrup, and of course some granola.
  Wifi 15/1 Mbit/s
- [The Hot Spot Uyuni](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HPEjo42DhMAZD8WE7) - almost certainly the best restaurant in Uyuni, but
  expensive.
  The 5 course tasting menu was 210bs (\$30) and 7 course tasting menu was 280bs ($40),
  which is outrageously expensive for this area, although the equivalent of a moderately priced meal in Europe.
  The 7 courses were all very, very good -
  so good the waiter has to take 1-2 minutes upon serving each one just to explain what you're looking at and what all
  the ingredients are - highly innovative cuisine that would be hard to replicate, and of course it all tasted very
  good.
  The juice was a different story, it was watered down, and would have contained sugar if I hadn't
  explicitly stated no sugar - I hadn't thought to explicitly state no water - the juice was not worthwhile.
  There is also a 14bs charge for using a card payment.
  Overall, this was worth the experience given such an elaborate fine dining meal would have cost \$200 upwards in the
  West, so worth the merely internationally moderate price tag here.
  WiFi 20/7 Mbit/s
- [Vigus](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BL7Aez68b32RxbjeA) - they'd sold out of both the llama steak and the beef pepper
  steak, so I had to go with the lomo mantado (which is supposed to be similar to lomo saltado in Peru but wasn't).
  Nevertheless it was decent, wholesome, steak on thick cut fries and 2 fried eggs on top,
  and lots of rice and a couple items bit of side salad, tomato, cucumber and onion slices.
  I left most of the rice as it wasn't that good and there were plenty of calories to fill up on, plus there was a loaf
  of bread and olive oil and not balsamic vinegar.
  Has wifi
- [Rufos Burger](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1jGrjquuaNun51JQ6) - the Lomito Rofos is basically a croissant with a very thin
  beef strip, ham, egg and tomato.
  I think I might have gotten bacterial food poisoning from here though as I developed a headache (rare for me), and it
  seems unlikely to be from dehydration as it still lingered the next day
  even though I was consciously hydrating from the night before.
  Not going to risk trying the regular burger here when there are other places to try.
  Doesn't really have wifi, the staff gave me an `Irene` network from a QR code on her phone for my phone that promptly
  disappeared before I could use it on my laptop

Not Recommended:

- [Bouquet Du Vin Vinoteca](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4sSnLEqyfrZ73ryx8) -
  another 4.8 rated restaurant that does not deserve its rating.
  I tried their lunch menu for 25 BOB,
  a peanut soup and spicy chicken with rice and potato.
  A lot of locals were eating this, and I'm sure it's fine for locals,
  but by international standards this was extremely mediocre and not worth the cheap price.
  The chicken was mainly wing, the rice was soft, the soup was just full of cheap pasta.
  Perhaps their evening menu of burgers is better,
  but nobody I know who is a good cook or a good restaurant would serve this food.
  How you do anything is how you do everything.
  Has wifi

TODO:

- [Ensis](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Hk8XxE5gx9oj8gCn9) - 4.8, expensive here at over $20 per main but should be good
- [Las Carmencitas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mLAbz9mHjbFxUY617) - 4.8 cafe, drinks & desserts, didn't see any real food
  on menu
- [Mr Taco Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sDcKhKhsskdth5tK7) - 4.9
- [Esther barbecue](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WxD18fybKHhd9Kcj8) - 4.7
- ["La chapaquita" Churrasquería](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VBvG7WRrp214EKATA) - 4.8

## Cochabamba

Apparently the gastronomic (food) capital of Bolivia.

If I ever return to Bolivia I will want to put this to the test.

The problem is that the cost of travel more than negates any food travel as you could instead just upgrade to high end
or michelin star restaurants anywhere you happen to be in the world instead.

## Santa Cruz de la Sierra

Commercial centre.

Only did a short layover here.
