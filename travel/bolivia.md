## Summary

## Currency Issue

Bolivia uses the Boliviano (BOB).
Exchange rate on of Jan 2026 is artificially pegged by the Bolivian government to roughly 7 BOB per \$1 and
9 BOB per £1, but the actual market rate is far more BOB per dollar or GBP.

There is a big problem with the official rate being far lower number of BOB
than you would get on a real market exchange rate,
meaning you should not use ATMs or Card payments
as the banks will scam you for 70% more foreign currency than if you just converted foreign cash to BOB on the
free market.

Bring CASH (USD, EUR, GBP) to convert at exchanges instead of using cards and ATMs.

## La Paz

### Best Areas to Stay in La Paz

- [Sopocachi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/x57fBhFJv9syfj5UA) - good all-round area, central, walkable, good cafes,
  restaurants, bars, and easy access to the Mi Teleferico
- [Centro Histórico](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UBrv8Xgfx2FJUbYp8) - close to Plaza Murillo, good for sightseeing, but busy
  and noisy at night
- [Miraflores](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1hEXCaajebHANiG96) - green parks suburb close to the centre
- [Zona Sur (Calacoto & San Miguel)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uLQsS6s3a2476KPc6) - far out suburb, quieter, greener, and
  more modern. Slightly lower altitude, good for acclimatizing, with upscale dining and shopping. Less touristy, more
  residential
