## Summary

I used Saily e-sim in Bolivia as it was the cheapest I could find at the time,
but be sure to check all the [Mobile e-Sim providers](../travel.md#mobile-e-sims)
I list in the travel overview page as prices can change.

## Currency Issue

Bolivia uses the Boliviano (BOB).
Exchange rate on of Jan 2026 is artificially pegged by the Bolivian government to roughly 7 BOB per \$1 and
9 BOB per £1, but the actual market rate is far more BOB per dollar or GBP.

There is a big problem with the official rate being far lower number of BOB
than you would get on a real market exchange rate,
meaning you should not use ATMs or Card payments
as the banks will scam you for 70% more foreign currency than if you just converted foreign cash to BOB on the
free market.

Bring CASH (USD, EUR, GBP) to convert at exchanges instead of using cards and ATMs.

My host recommended I check the exchanges [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AH5d64d6SPfd57bj9) since there are several,
but I found they were all pegging USD to 6.96 BOB everywhere and the only variation was on GBP, Peruvian SOL and EUR.

I dumped my Peruvian Sol at an exchange rate of 2.8 BOB
and converted Euros at 11 BOB as that was the best relative exchange rate out of my 3 reserve currencies of USD, GBP and
EUR.

For dollars, I found [MoneyBox](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iAP5RAWYYjPErCcaA) was offering 9.50 BOB per USD, but they
don't take Euros or British Pounds at all.

## La Paz

[La Paz](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QD32tMLounS5s5Vz5) looks exactly how you'd expect a 3rd world country to look.

This is probably one of the worst capitals I've seen in the world,
which is saying a lot considering I've travelled to over 50 countries at this point, many of them multiple times.

The restaurant scene cannot hold a candle to neighbouring [Peru](peru.md).

La Paz is also the highest administrative capital in the world at 3500m above sea level,
so you will tire quickly going uphill.

Within 2 hours of walking around the Sopacachi and Centro areas I have no plans to visit La Paz again.

I had heard a couple guys in Cusco complaining they spent a week here and wishing they hadn't wasted more than 2 days.

I would say 1 day stopover and then move on.

### Best Areas to Stay in La Paz

Don't stay in La Paz, transit through and go somewhere nice instead, but if you have to stay 1-2 nights for flights:

- [Sopocachi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/x57fBhFJv9syfj5UA) - good all-round area, central, walkable, good cafes,
  restaurants, bars, and easy access to the Mi Teleferico
- [Centro Histórico](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UBrv8Xgfx2FJUbYp8) - close to Plaza Murillo, good for sightseeing, but busy
  and noisy at night
- [Miraflores](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1hEXCaajebHANiG96) - green parks suburb close to the centre
- [Zona Sur (Calacoto & San Miguel)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uLQsS6s3a2476KPc6) - far out suburb, quieter, greener, and
  more modern. Slightly lower altitude, good for acclimatizing, with upscale dining and shopping. Less touristy, more
  residential

### Taxi Apps in La Paz

- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/) - my favourite, usually half the price of Uber but cash only
- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) - since I didn't have any BOB cash I took an Uber for 42 BOB (\$6) but found the driver
  charged me 90 BOB instead by taking the long way.
  I had to challenge this in the Uber app.
  You're already paying the worst exchange rate by using card payment
  rather than converting to market rate cash as per the Currency Issue section above
