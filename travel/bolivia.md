## Summary

Bolivia is a very 3rd world country, I struggle to finda reason to spent time and money visiting it.

I used Saily e-sim in Bolivia as it was the cheapest I could find at the time,
but be sure to check all the [Mobile e-Sim providers](../travel.md#mobile-e-sims)
I list in the travel overview page as prices can change.

## Currency Issue

Bolivia uses the Boliviano (BOB).
Exchange rate on of Jan 2026 is artificially pegged by the Bolivian government to roughly 7 BOB per \$1 and
9 BOB per £1, but the actual market rate is far more BOB per dollar or GBP.

There is a big problem with the official rate being far lower number of BOB
than you would get on a real market exchange rate,
meaning you should not use ATMs or Card payments
as the banks will scam you for 70% more foreign currency than if you just converted foreign cash to BOB on the
free market.

Bring CASH (USD, EUR, GBP) to convert at exchanges instead of using cards and ATMs.

My host recommended I check the exchanges [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AH5d64d6SPfd57bj9) since there are several,
but I found they were all pegging USD to 6.96 BOB everywhere and the only variation was on GBP, Peruvian SOL and EUR.

I dumped my Peruvian Sol at an exchange rate of 2.8 BOB
and converted Euros at 11 BOB as that was the best relative exchange rate out of my 3 reserve currencies of USD, GBP and
EUR.

For dollars, I found [MoneyBox](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iAP5RAWYYjPErCcaA) was offering 9.50 BOB per USD, but they
don't take Euros or British Pounds at all.
Note there is no sign above this little shop unit.

## La Paz

[La Paz](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QD32tMLounS5s5Vz5) looks exactly how you'd expect a 3rd world country to look.

This is probably one of the worst capitals I've seen in the world,
which is saying a lot considering I've travelled to over 50 countries at this point, many of them multiple times.

The restaurant scene cannot hold a candle to neighbouring [Peru](peru.md).

La Paz is also the highest administrative capital in the world at 3500m above sea level,
so you will tire quickly going uphill.

Within 2 hours of walking around the Sopacachi and Centro areas I have no plans to visit La Paz again.

I had heard a couple guys in Cusco complaining they spent a week here and wishing they hadn't wasted more than 2 days.

I would say 1 day stopover and then move on.

### El Alto Airport

The airport is very small and the domestic departure lounge to Uyuni (for visiting the salt flats) has 3 cafes,
one of which was closed at 7am, and a couple souvenir shops.
There was not much to eat.

### Best Areas to Stay in La Paz

Don't stay in La Paz, transit through and go somewhere nice instead, but if you have to stay 1-2 nights for flights:

- [Sopocachi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/x57fBhFJv9syfj5UA) - good all-round area, central, walkable, good cafes,
  restaurants, bars, and easy access to the Mi Teleferico
- [Centro Histórico](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UBrv8Xgfx2FJUbYp8) - close to Plaza Murillo, good for sightseeing, but busy
  and noisy at night
- [Miraflores](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1hEXCaajebHANiG96) - green parks suburb close to the centre
- [Zona Sur (Calacoto & San Miguel)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uLQsS6s3a2476KPc6) - far out suburb, quieter, greener, and
  more modern. Slightly lower altitude, good for acclimatizing, with upscale dining and shopping. Less touristy, more
  residential

<!--

Greenhouse was pretty basic, the fridge gets locked and the taps only have cold water, which is horrible for shaving.
The front gate cannot be opened from inside, there are electric release buttons at the reception desk and kitchen.
Do not stay here again.
Wifi 202/34 Mbit/s

### Taxi Apps in La Paz

- [InDrive](https://indrive.com/) - my favourite, usually half the price of Uber but cash only
- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) - since I didn't have any BOB cash I took an Uber for 42 BOB (\$6) but found the driver
  charged me 90 BOB instead by taking the long way.
  I had to challenge this in the Uber app.
  You're already paying the worst exchange rate by using card payment
  rather than converting to market rate cash as per the [Currency Issue](#currency-issue) section above.
  On the way back to the airport the other Uber driver did it too,
  too the long way saying it was faster and then charging 92BOB instead of 43 BOB shown on the app.
  Uber originally declined to fix it and it had to be escalated to support.
  I would avoid using Uber next time
  and try to stick with InDrive as it is harder for them to change the price on you when you are holding cash,
  especially if you have small notes for the right amount

### Attractions in La Paz

I am really struggling to make this section as this is not a tourist destination.

- [Plaza Murillo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qRzPnRrBW3Dapjch6)

### Restaurants in La Paz

- [Biofilia Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VNjTY3vQjsy7mwnP8) - the most gentrified coffee shop I’ve seen in La Paz
  with an excellent menu of both drinks and desserts -
  there are 3 dessert sections,
  one of which is a Biofit healthy option with gluten free and sugar alternatives like date syrup and stevia.
  Must visit.
  The Acai Latte was decent.
  The classic bruschetta was one large toast with lots of tomatoes, it was good although could use more garlic and
  onion.
  The Pistachio & Matcha Mouse is their most popular dessert but it was sold out.
  The Bunuelos Biofilia with home made api was good though, just the right amount of sweetness, although I wish it was
  bigger.
  The Copoazu Lassi was really good, just the right amount of sweetness too, a local twist on an indian idea.
  I could eat here all day, the place is actually vegetarian and vegan but I didn't notice until later on because the
  menu was so good.
  They also have acai bowl and tropical fruit bowl,
  I wish I had more time to eat my way through their menu as this was the highlight of La Paz.
  WiFi 25/33 Mbit/s
- [Beef & Beer](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nKqkXhhhbZqMHv7w8) - the Beef&Beer Sirloin steak was great, covered in fried
  onions and red peppers, with good fries and a side salad.
  The pineapple with ice cream and dulce de leche was good too
  I was very satisfied with the food here.
  Has wifi
- [Inti Restaurant Café Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WkqWwAB6PdbWiggX7) - the paiche prehistoric fish ceviche was red
  not white fish.
  I had to ask if they'd given me the right thing.
  The ceviche itself was ok, nice and limey with onion and a few crispy wafers.
  Next time I'd probably go with a burger instead.
  The juice had sugar in it, apparently that's what they call natural in Bolivia.
  Ask specifically for no sugar.
  WiFi was full signal but intermittent traffic, unusable
- [Hipermaxi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Y13xM4XfvMDgNPca8) - supermarket

Not Recommended:

- [Sushi Udon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eXBTaukpN6SHBhnS8) - cheap but not worth it at all -
  I have no idea how this place could possibly receive a 4.8 rating,
  it is not authentic or even good quality.
  The udon is not authentic, it's just spaghetti, and the sushi is just rice with whatever ingredients.
  Don't waste one of your meals on this place,
  I wish I'd gone to La Rufina instead of taking a punt on this one based on its undeservedly high rating.
  Doesn't have wifi

## Uyuni

[Uyuni](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fAbtQgzw4HNeFRFp9) is even worse than La Paz, it barely has gravel roads as of Jan 2026,
which were flooded all over town making it hard to cross streets.

After 55 countries I have never seen such a 3rd world place.

People travel here only to see the salt flats. It is a desert.

### Taxis in Uyuni

Neither Uber nor InDrive worked for me in Uyuni.

Uber had absolutely nothing and InDrive had only 2 drivers that ignored my request, even when I raised it to 25 BOB.

I ended up taking an airport taxi, usually a last resort, after fixing the price to 20 BOB up front.

### Restaurants in Uyuni

<!--

[Piedra Blanca Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DrShnMTTrcUcRnvx9) is on the southwest edge of town,
about 10-15 minutes walk. Has hot water all day including the taps for shaving.
Wifi 38/22 Mbit/s

-->

- [Llama Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oKFPxdX3pCcD2ABQ6) - gentrified cafe. The bruschetta was good with lots of fresh
  tomato on it, and the porridge with fruits was good too (mango, banana and strawberry).
  Has wifi
- [Memos Coffee Bistro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dB9irZjQMLARsQtm8) - I came for the acai bowl but they didn't have it.
  I tried the granola bowl instead and that was very good, up to gentrified coffee shop standards, yoghurt topped with
  a row of strawberry and banana slices, blueberries, a couple dried orange slices, syrup, and of course some granola.
  Wifi 15/1 Mbit/s
- [Rufos Burger](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1jGrjquuaNun51JQ6) - the Lomito Rofos is basically a croissant with a very thin
  beef strip, ham, egg and tomato.
  Doesn't really have wifi, the staff gave me an `Irene` network from a QR code on her phone for my phone that promptly
  disappeared before I could use it on my laptop.
  I think I might have gotten bacterial food poisoning from here though as I developed a headache (rare for me), and it
  seems unlikely to be from dehydration as I had some of it the next day even though I was conscious to hydrate.
  Not going to risk trying the regular burger here when there are other places to try

Not Recommended:

- [Bouquet Du Vin Vinoteca](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4sSnLEqyfrZ73ryx8) -
  another 4.8 rated restaurant that does not deserve its rating.
  I tried their lunch menu for 25 BOB,
  a peanut soup and spicy chicken with rice and potato.
  A lot of locals were eating this, and I'm sure it's fine for locals,
  but by international standards this was extremely mediocre and not worth the cheap price.
  The chicken was mainly wing, the rice was soft, the soup was just full of cheap pasta.
  Perhaps their evening menu of burgers is better,
  but nobody I know who is a good cook or a good restaurant would serve this food.
  How you do anything is how you do everything.
  Has wifi
