## Driving in Germany

The autobahn - the german highway - is long.

If you have a need for speed, Germany is probably one of the best places to drive your car.

Germany is a much bigger country which you feel after driving through Belgium and then hitting the much more vast
driving distances in Germany.

You can expect to drive for 8 hours to go from West to East Germany.

## Bonn

TODO

## Berlin

Berlin is a relatively affordable capital with good restaurants
and what feels like much lower population density than London.

It is not as popping as London at 9pm on a Saturday night as a result though.

## Brandenburg

A small town to the West of Berlin with some old gothic buildings, a good place to walk around with an ice cream.

## Cologne

Large cathedral city with a selection of restaurants.

[Fräulein Herborths](https://www.fraeuleinherborths.de/) is recommended here.

## Dresden

Surprisingly nice, lots of historic architecture has survived the war, unlike Coventry
(both cities were victims of war crime bombings by both sides in WWII to try to demoralize the other side).

Coventry is a complete dump by comparison to Dresden.

- [Ayers Rock](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3pSVvUWNEmTQL6Ev5) - Australian restaurant with excellent menu.
  Had to do the Kangaroo steak, which comes with glazed granny smith horizontal apple slices,
  cranberry cream sauce, roasted macadamia nuts and country potatoes (€27).
  This kangaroo steak diverted me as I was on my way to Kutscherschänke - Uriges Wirtshau next door!
  The Kangaroo steak was slim and slighly gamey, drowned in cranberry cream sauce, which looks like a red wine sauce.
  The "country potatoes" are just crispy wedges.
  It was all amazing, totally worth it on all fronts.
  I could have eaten it twice in a row, and was still a bit hungry as it's a good sized plate but I hoovered it up, so
  added extra sides of bush beans with nuts and Australian bush bread with garlic butter.
  The bush beans are just long green beans with herbs, red onion and macadamia nuts (which I love),
  the bush bread comes in wedges that look like if bread was a cake slice.
  I could skip the beans, but the bush bread is worth it,
  I used it to mop up all the cranberry sauce from the kangaroo steak.
  I've just decided that macadamia nuts should be added throughout cooking, costs be damned.
  I blew €40 on just the food without drinks and before tip.
  But it was good.
  The burgers all look amazing too (apparently the best in town according to the waiter, and in this case I am not
  skeptical),
  and only while I was eating and still marvelling at the menu did I notice the triple steaks of beef,
  ostrich and kangaroo with mango-chili-chutney red-wine-honey-sauce, sweet mash and australian bush bread which I will
  definitely go with instead next time! (€33)
  They also have crocodile skewers (had them in Thailand already) with roasted veg and sweet potato mash, and of course
  Sirloin steak but why settle for something so common when you have this menu
  (although it does come with Tasmanian mountain pepper butter).
  Wifi is open capture portal 7/10 Mbit/s
- [Wilma Wunder Dresden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dQytPtuNovsXJ39a9) - tourist trap restaurant chain but has a good
  seating and view of the Altmarkt square. Stopped here in a pinch since my first choice Rauschenbach deli was closed.
  The eggs benedict with smoked salmon was ok quality but small for €17!
  European prices suck.
  The bread also wasn't as good as the usual gentrified cafe sourdough.
  You might want to just get a drink here

TODO:

- [Kutscherschänke - Uriges Wirtshau](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pLfTUqNTBhoSBjwY6) - go for the Saxon black beer meat of
  beef with onions, red cabbage and homemade pretzel dumplings
- [Rauschenbach deli](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SQHHhKqAcSyrMnYd8) - was closed for the week but not updated on Google Maps

## Dusseldorf

A city with a great selection of restaurants.

"Shawarma city" takeaway is recommended here, good food and good prices.
There is often a queue around the corner for it across the hours of the evening.

## Essen

Surprisingly mass immigrated with a lot of graffiti, with homeless people along the high street.

Limited dining options, middle eastern probably being among the best options.

## Frankfurt

Large metropolitan multicultural city with many restaurants.

[MA'LOA Poké Bowl](https://maloa.com/) is recommended, and [BKK Thai Street Food](https://bkkthaistreetfood.com/) is also popular.

## Hanover

A city with a lot of middle eastern restaurants.

[Zambezi Springs](https://www.zambezi-springs.de/) is recommended here - rare access to good African cuisine.

## Königswinter

Lovely small germanic town. This is what I imagined German paradise to look like.

[Gasthaus Lichtenberg](https://gasthaus-lichtenberg.de/) is recommended here.

## Potsdam

City just outside the west of Berlin.

[KOI Sushi, Grill & Soup](https://koi-sushi-grill.eatbu.com/) is highly recommended here. They don't speak English but
it's worth the translation effort, excellent food and good prices.
The Thai tom yum soup and the sushi are recommended.
