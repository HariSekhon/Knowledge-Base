### Czechia / Czech Republic

I still call it Czech Republic and struggle with the new name of Czechia -
it's too similar a name to the war torn Chechnya.
They didn't think about about the negative branding on this rename.

#### Prague

A brilliant historic capital, famed for cheap good quality beer.
By the 2000s there were literally signs on the front of bars saying *"No English stag parties"*.
Such is the bad reputation of the English lads on holiday!

Prague has many good restaurants and excellent architecture in the old town.

Unfortunately the prices have gone up a lot in the years since I've first been,
expect Western priced restaurants, coffee shops and expensive hotels.
You may want to consider staying in a hostel here just due to the prices.

You will hear American accents often in Prague, it is this tourism that has caused the somewhat high prices.

##### Taxis in Prague

- [Bolt](https://bolt.eu/en-cz/) - usually a bit cheaper than Uber in my experience, but this can fluctate so check both
- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/cz/en/)

##### Parking in Prague

Parking is a nightmare in Prague, like many anti-car European cities, and due to residents parking permits.

You can use Park & Ride sites on the outskirts around the end of the metro lines,
although they rack up if leaving your car there for days or weeks.

[This article](https://www.hirecarprague.com/useful-info-about-prague/where-can-you-park-without-paying-free-parking-tips-in-prague-and-brno#:~:text=Outskirts.,%2C%20Vyso%C4%8Dany%2C%20Hodkovi%C4%8Dky%20%C4%8Di%20Kr%C4%8D.)
has suggestions for free street parking places.

Prague Airport Parking C is very expensive - 1400kc (£48) for 24 hours, 1800kc (£62) for 2 days.
Arrange a nearby parking next time

I parked at [Parkoviště](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1VKm9r9w2B6dtKTs6) Zličín as even the Park & Rides were full there,
but even out there it's still roughly €25 per week.

<!--

##### Hostels in Prague

My favourite hostels are:

- [Safestay Prague Charles Bridge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yP4rjjR6YxpH8RrH7) - most central - called Equity Point on
  Agoda, not sure why
- [Sophie's Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/E5meMyWoWzhwB24S8) - bit south, but walkable and the best interior
- [Brix Bar & Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/77FwRg52yLZoJm5R7) - further out but near my favourite brunch area in
  Prague around the border of Prague 2 and Prague 3

...but check for fluctuating rates as I stayed at Sophie's for £15 per night and then the next week it was £25 per night

I didn't really like:

- [Seven Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xt3kv1g2PsEfoUiz8) - even though I got a private room the toilets and bathroom
  were like commununal school toilets rather than the nice en suite of Safestay or Sophies's Hostel

-->

##### Restaurants in Prague

My favourite Brunch area is [Prague 3, Žižkov](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZXwfEH74FakwwnyV8) as it has the most good
brunch restaurants and better prices, as well as my favourite Acai place.
My second favourite food area is [Prague 2, Vinohrady](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hjsApm13g4qdUYzN6),
as it also has a row of good brunch and coffee places on Angelicka.

- [Mexicka](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VSyN7FP2htPcRWPc7) - the best mexican I ever remember having, modern and vibrant,
  this is an unexpected hidden gem further out in Prague 7, an otherwise quiet neighbourhood. It's a large venue, packed
  out even on a Tuesday night, amazing for food and drinks, with 3 levels of tables and a bar on the middle floor.
  People reserve here. It thins out at 10pm as that is when the kitchen closes.
  This place is so good it's reminded me I need to go to Mexico.
  4 dishes nearly killed me, but they were worth it.
  The tortilla chips were very good and served with a large amount of guacamole (pro tip: ask for salsa and lime).
  The prawn tortilla was smaller than expected but tasted amazing.
  The pork mole with pineapple was amazing, good quality meat that pulls apart easily in a bed of brown sauce,
  order the rice and beans side to soak up all the sauce.
  The desserts look amazing too, but I was so stuff I just went with the acai banana sorbet and pina colada ice cream.
  This is a must-return-to place.
  I ended spending over 800 kc (£30) for one without alcohol, which is expensive for Prague,
  but this is an experience place, girls are taking pics all over the illuminated upper steps.
  I can't believe it only opened 3 months prior in March 2025 given how popular it is, and out of the way.
  Wifi is slow at 1 Mbit/s but people come here to socialize so probably nobody notices
- [Cacao](https://www.google.com/maps) - excellent menu and location overlooking the square in front of Palladium
  shopping center, so in the heart of Prague a few minutes from the famous clock tower and next to the powder tower.
  Catch the breakfast menu which is only available until 11am weekdays (who wakes up this early?!) or 1pm at weekends.
  Has a good selection of coffees/tea, even matcha/sencha/rooibos blood orange, lots of fresh juices, lots of smoothies,
  iced teas, detox waters, alcohols, breakfasts with eggs, Acai bowls, ice creams, cakes, baguettes, burgers, salads,
  poke and super food bowls.
  The croissant with cheddar, bacon and scrambled eggs (169kc) was not big enough though, and the cheese in it is not
  some grated cheddar but instead those preprocessed cheese slices you are not supposed to eat.
  I'd take the croissant with scrambled eggs variant (139kc) without the cheddar and bacon next time.
  Due to the not huge portion size, I ordered a second breakfast - the Eggs by Choice (159kc) - frieds or scrambed - I
  went with 3 x fried eggs rather than scrambled this time, with 1 bacon rasher, grilled tomato topped with parmesan,
  and "pastry" which is just a bread basket of 1 piece white and 1 piece brown bread.
  The Boost juice with pineapple, banana, kiwi and orange was as good as it could be,
  and comes in a tall slim glass, probably 250ml.
  The acai bowl is cheaper than other places but a bit small,
  comes with a small bowl of strawberries and granola & nuts, which can overpower the amount of acai, but still good.
  Wifi 8/13 Mbit/s
- [Bredovský Dvůr](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wbmfCjzZK1WWVjSx9) - on a side road in a central area, so less of a tourist
  trap, but it was still full, I had to wait for a table.
  The wild boar with mashed potatoes was good, although portion size could have been bigger and the onion jam was a bit
  savoury for my taste.
  The venison is even better with a slightly sweet red wine sauce (and apparently root vegetables blended into it)
  and 3 medium sized potato rosti triangles.
  This would be perfect if it was with mash and actual whole root vegetables, as the venison is good quality lean meat.
  The restaurant as a big screen TV on which the football was playing, but they have NO Wifi.
- [Crunch](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3qYxUCDFq9aN2Qr38) - good menu and reasonable prices as it's a bit away from the
  centre, but they didn't have ham so couldn't try the eggs benedict and went with the turkish eggs instead.
  The turkish eggs was surprisingly good though, it came with 3 poached eggs on a bed of yoghurt with a generous amount
  of olive oil and 1 sourdough toast. The yoghurt was not plain but had a a zing to it, like it was mixed with lemon.
  The "Protein Drink" is a chocolate milk but has this awful artificial sweet taste to it like protein shakes,
  I left half of it, skip that next time. Wifi 105/21 Mbit/s
- [Pausteria café restaurant garden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/R8m6KTiJEY9Hg96Y9) - good menu, all day breakfast, has Acai
  bowl. The Beef Rib main was a large drizzle style plate with 2 square pieces of beef, a potato dumpling ball that was
  almost like a cake, and a green vegetable puree. Not sure it was relatively worth it for 389kc (£13.60), but the Acai
  was decent, as was the chai latte. Overall blew 880 kc £32), which is pricey for Prague. Wifi 39/7 Mbit/s
- [Bistro Cafē Laskavá](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aEYi7nFrrLucC1gm9) - next to Gron above, lovely benedict (eggs benedict)
  is pricey gentrified at 285kc (£9.60), and comes on two halves of a croissant,
  which makes it lack a bit of the fill factor of a regular eggs benedict, but has bacon, a few small slices of avocado,
  half a passionfruit, and few sprinkles of pomegranate seeds.
  Very gentrified! Laskava has indoor and outdoor al fresco seating. Wifi is only 2/1 Mbit/s outside though
- [ACAI POKE superfood & espresso bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GTMiCCFtRGxyHFSh8) - my favourite Acai place in Prague.
  The brazilian lime poke bowl with mango,
  apple, berries and yoghurt is my favourite (the berries were frozen though), 260kc (£9).
  The "Hi, Barbie" and Superpower bowls are pretty similar.
  It's a bit of a walk if you're coming from the centre to Prague 3 Žižkov for it though. 81/40 Mbit/s wifi
- [Café Pavlač](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mdmM4dTRfNCLTkhe7) - very reasonably priced scrambled eggs and a garden out the
  back, as well as plenty of decent seating indoors
- [VinCaffé](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9igDfXQ33FDcCTkF9) - indoor and nice rear garden seating, all day brunch, and good
  daily weekday menu with very reasonable prices compared to most tourist trap places in Prague.
  The scrambled eggs with ham are totally worth it for 145 kc (£5), in a homemade style with 2 pieces of dark rye with
  nuts, and 2 pieces of white baguette, as well as a salad with a nice light dressing.
  Wifi 69/23 Mbit/s even in the garden
- [Bistro Sugar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e1AohD1qMHWY2Vx37) - nice venue, reasonable prices, good scrambled eggs
  (189kc / £6.60), a few seats out front, nice interior. Wifi drops off outside though
- [Venue](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kqx8RZ3vg4b2ea2ZA) - brunch restaurant with 2 venues on 2 adjacent streets,
  [Rytířská](https://maps.app.goo.gl/E4dpjqSEQ8mJzQCm8) and [Havelská](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pJjv1UAPdnvpgDkH9). All
  day brunch, has scrambled eggs on a hot dog bun at moderate price but what brings me back is the Acai bowl - it's
  easily one of the best Acai bowls I've had in Prague, deep purple colour topped with nuts, coconut flakes, strawberry,
  blueberry and raspberry, a kumquat and a drizzle of almond butter, chia and pumpkin seeds.
  This is my second favourite Acai bowl in Prague after the Acai Poke place above.
  Open until 6pm and has a second location at [Dusni](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EimXByt64jX74e6X6).
  Wifi 33/5 Mbit/s
- [The Spot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/i8Bj5zRGHGzZSpSo6) - good brunch menu and prices. Has outdoor tables on the street
  and a bunch more inside. The scrambled eggs, while reasonably priced, wasn't that big. The Acai bowl was decent.
  Wifi 15/19 Mbit/s
- [Khromberry](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wXe8X751536WM21x5) - all day brunch, eggs benedict with salmon was very
  reasonably priced but not large, although it came on a very think square slice of bread.
  The venue was top notch in decor and the music my type too, similar to Thailand, hot girls singing chill.
  Stunning 529/43 Mbit/s Wifi
- [Honest Taste](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YfNEKLoGyCr6mjLX8) - breakfast restaurant that closes at 3pm
  (kitchen closes at 2:30pm).
  Eggs benedict was moderately priced at 240kc (£8) and good, with a good small vinaigrette side leaf salad.
  6/13 Mbit/s wifi
- [GRØN Bistro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/S7U5vCdyZ9Js8CrY6) - reasonable prices gentrified bistro, closes at 9pm, go for
  the food!
  The piri piri boneless chicken thigh is excellent, with homemade piri piri sauce and pineapple salsa,
  and comes with a piece of bread and a really good salad with pink pickles.
  Get a side of truffles potatoes to make the plate complete. Wifi 56/25 Mbit/s
- [Herbivore](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ATehbfWrdjUikmSo8) - vegan cafe, has Acai bowl which is small but very good,
  topped with mango, chia seeds and coconut flakes. It's small size is ok because at 165kc it's nearly half the price of
  other places, and makes a perfectly sized snack. Friendly staff too
- [Rio AÇAÍ A Smoothie Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NSQhsSVAxoU2rQau8) - acai cup was better than expected for a
  commercial-chain-looking place, there are 3 options - I've had the Rio which lots of granola, chocolate flakes, and
  other crunchy bits, some fruit, peanut/almond butter. I've also had the Power which is also good, has some protein
  powder, peanuts, peanut butter, as well as strawberry,
  blueberry, banana, oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds etc. Within my top 3 acai places in Prague right now
- [Coffee and Riot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FEFbdsGqQcGxyYVq7) - tucked away coffee shop that does brunch until 2pm
  Wednesday to Sunday (why only those days??). Wifi 25/0.8 Mbit/s
- [Palacinka](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KadbzY1nJPRxY7kYA) - scrambled eggs plate was nicely balanced with 2 sourdough
  half toasts, herb butter, lettuce, pink pickled cauliflower, although the scrambled eggs were a bit running for my
  preference. Only available weekdays though, which is weird. Wifi 6/4 Mbit/s even in outside seating by the street
- [U Matěje Kotrby Restaurant and Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Vv2P72veUTERNFtq7) - the pork goulash in dark beer with
  bread dumplings, fresh red onions and pickled pepper, was one of the best I've had in Prague. Wifi 11/20 Mbit/s
- [Sweet & Pepper Days](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cWsk4zTSLVPon3Yo7) - good eggs benedict on a homemade flatbread with bok
  choi in a tasty asian-style sauce, but a bit pricey at 330kc, and 105kc for chai latte, golden milk latte or beetroot
  cocoa late, compared to 90kc at the adjacent place. Main and 2 drinks came to 540kc (£18) which is pricey for here
- [Coffee Factory](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rENuDDfPFsXg74TLA) - good menu, but western prices,
  as they are used to foreigners. Eggs benedict is 250kc (~£9). 46/33 Mbit/s wifi
- [Puro Gelato](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HZsGvXW3dZTUDUx99) - award winning ice cream shop, very popular. I had the mango
  sorbet, pink gooseberry sorbet and poppy seed ice cream, all great. Wifi 12/2 Mbit/s
- [Letenský zámeček a zahrádky na Letné](https://maps.app.goo.gl/beYT7M4wuV8dYhqt6) - upmarket beer garden restaurant at
  the top plateau of Letna Park with a good view and good menu. The beef rump steak with asparagus and potato fontain
  was good, the pea and spinach cream soup was also good and the chocolate cake with crushed pistachio centre was
  indulgently rich. They also give bread with balsamic vinegar dip.
  Overall a bit pricey, I spent nearly £25 without a drink and before tip
- [Krčma u Parašutistů](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ea2PN2d27cgygp5S8) - popular local pub restaurant with czech dishes.
  I couldn't get a table here one evening so came back at 5:30pm before the rush.
  Had so much beef goulash by this point, and potato pancakes with that be grated & fried,
  so opted to go with the pork knuckle with cabbage and potato dumplings instead.
  Wifi 31/24 Mbit/s
- [Sad Man's Tongue](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hE7mDzv2r592roT76) - 1950s dive bar restaurant on a side street with a
  mango chilli burger called Chica Chica Boom (360kc / €15). Good menu, Western prices, has a large cocktail menu,
  the usual spirits but little variety of soft drinks, tea, coffee.
  It's a drinking and burger place.
  The fries came soft, would have been better if crispy.
  The mango chilli sauce is totally worth it though, ask for extra on the side to dip your fries.
  This is a good option if you wake up at 11pm and everything else is closed, the kitchen here is open until midnight.
  Wifi didn't work, and it's CASH ONLY
- [La Piccola Perla](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3BrVgTYGAdYQ38u76) - Italian, if you need a break from so much goulash,
  svickova etc. Has great pizzas. I had the piccola perla pizza with parma ham, salami, marinated red peppers,
  mozarella, tomato sauce and gorgonzola
- [Kozlovna U Paukerta](https://maps.app.goo.gl/x7ybwqKLophZyA9e6) - good menu, surprisingly good svitchkova (beef in
  cream sauce with cranberries) and Karlovy Vary dumplings, which are like Carlsbad dumplings, pieces of bread glued
  together with egg. Prices are a little on the moderately high side due to the fairly prime location on main road by
  bridge than some other places and being mostly tourists (eg. they don't have cesnecka like quite a few restaurants
  here because tourists don't know to ask for it, and the duck with red cabbage and dumplings is cheaper and twice the
  grams at Restaurace U Šumavy). 92/103 Mbit/s wifi
- [Lokál Nad Stromovkou](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vmcAsymPABEa7Yzz5) - popular pub restaurant with some outdoor seating
  and dog friendly as a lot of people from the Královská obora Stromovka park seem to come here, it was practically a
  dog convention outside.
  The pork with roasted potatoes is a speciality of this restaurant
  and came with a good sized slab of high quality lean pork,
  good sauce and was better than expected, although lacking a vegetable to complete the plate
- [Hostinec U Jendy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uM2wRo2ChYDTtuMc8) - a bit south out of the main tourist areas, legit local
  place, decent prices, authentic food - this is where locals come to eat and drink.
  The waitress didn't speak English though, and brought me the wrong dish (the goats cheese salad,
  which also looked great, instead of the horseradish mustard sausage).
  The garlic soup (cesneckna) was decent, but nothing special and typically small (still hunting for best cesnecka),
  although for 50kc I shouldn't complain as other places charge 90-130kc.
  The sausage with horseradish and mustard (klobasa s krenemska horcice) is a classic czech staple,
  just don't eat it too often as processed meat increases your risk of cancer.
  The sirloin beef in sauce is actually svickova (in cream sauce) with legit bread dumplings (houskove knedliky) and a
  little cranberry and cream and costs 200kc instead of the 300kc the tourist places are charging. Wifi 24/8 Mbit/s
- [Restaurace U Pinkasů](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sxSUhiZSN4W9MM1a9) - surprisingly decent for a central commercial
  location. Legit beef goulash and dumplings with good sauce and a sweet pepper, although only 150g of beef.
  Many locals drink and eat here, there is a good beer garden at the back running along a historic old church for a nice
  setting experience. Kitchen closes at 9pm and until 9:15pm they only serve 3 traditional czech dishes.
  The goulash came suspiciously fast, they must have a pot simmering ready to go, but it was still decent
- [Husinec restaurace](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DRHXfpx8wCBD2tXG9) - lovely outdoor seating at the back, good menu
  (although no cesnecka soup unless it's soup of the day, which was Friday when I was there).
  Moderately touristy prices eg.
  the beef goulash with varied dumplings is 300kc (£10) - the sauce and dumplings were very good,
  but it was a bit light on meat (150g compared to 200g at other restaurants), and a lot of the meat was fat.
  The homemade chocolate fondant with vanilla ice cream was good, although a bit pricey at 190kc (£6.80),
  and it could have been bigger.
  A mix of tourists and locals - one downside is that many europeans smoke outside. 31/5 Mbit/s wifi
- [Cafe Louvre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B6nLuNC6J5opguia7) - fancy cafe & restaurant with good decor and a couple czech
  specialities. The restaurant closes at 10pm but the cafe is open until 11:30pm where you can order the same food as
  the restaurant until 11pm. I had the pork shoulder in dark beer sauce with mashed potatoes, which came suspiciously
  quickly, but was good quality, albeit a little salty. The pork shoulder ia  large steak like piece in the centre of a
  moat of mashed potatoes holding in the dark sauce, with a stack of red onions on one side of the moat. No Wifi
- [be cafe Máj](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sU1FZzBTgisvN9n28) - the eggs benedict was nice on a toasted muffin but far too
  small as it only has 1 eggs and no ham or salmon. You get what you pay for, and you'd be better off paying for
  breakfast elsewhere unless you're on a diet.
  Better place to use just for a drink, has good seating and fast wifi 196/166 Mbit/s
- [Plzeňská restaurace U Sedlerů](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BXAK4ixex15R3vhB8) - the dark beer beef chilli goulash is
  good.
  There isn't a lot of meat, concentrated in the center of the plate and there is a lot of sauce, which is very good as
  that's where the flavour is.
  It doesn't come with dumplings unfortunately, you have to order them as a "side" although they come on the same plate
  in the goulash sauce.
  The Carlsbad Dumplings are good too (they are like pieces of bread glued together with egg)
  instead of the traditional czech dumplings.
  You need one of the two types of dumplings to mop up all the tasty sauce
- [Knedlin](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NhTxVVA9pTvHTBZs6) - dumpling shop with [a large variety](https://knedlin.cz/en/) of both sweet and savory dumplings.
  Ok for a snack. I had the pistacchio one. Fattening. They have no wifi!
- [ô-mai Coffee & Brunch](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eWNBWQU6C58PqGJv8) - a little south of the gentrified coffee shop
  boulevard of the places above, but eggs benedict is slightly more reasonably priced at 260kc.
  However, I didn't like the eggs benedict here due to the sriracha sauce and sweet brioche buns,
  it just didn't work for me, you may feel differently.
  I decided to give this place a second go and went with a normal scrambled eggs, which was also cheaper at 170kc and a
  better choice IMO. 80/40 Mbit/s wifi
- [The Bowls](https://maps.app.goo.gl/voc7pfFujH2phCHh8) - cheaper acai bowls than above, only 170kc (£5.80), but has
  more granola and little fruit by comparison, and the acai smoothie is watered down pink instead of purple. You get
  what you pay for. I would rather pay more for a better acai bowl at the above place. 5/3 Mbit/s wifi unreliable
  outside
- [Goodie Store & Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tAhdR1NS7C9FGE7C9) - convenient location only 2 blocks east of Muzeum,
  but the acai bowl is diluted and not pure, and for 235kc it's much better to go to ACAI POKE above
- [Beer Restaurant U Černého Medvěda (At the Black Bear)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DByx8UcajYxx1vB56) - the potato soup
  with mushroom was ok, need to try their goulash
- [MyRaw Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/acjCbKC1NuzfTbidA) - vegan cafe, but has an Acai smoothie bowl which is
  reasonable and topped with nuts and seeds granola, banana and strawberry. Wifi 92/25 Mbit/s
- [Červený Koŕal](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HTAR2u6kTg3So3457) - surprisingly decent reasonably priced Chinese food in the
  food court of [Máj Národní](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4CBcM613iaD9u9r18) shopping mall.
  For when you need a break from czech goulash, dumplings, duck etc. The name translates to Red Coral
- [Čínská Restaurace](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3ekUKBsu2i5CmEPt9) - literally translates to Chinese Restaurant - slightly
  pricier than Červený koŕal above but the portion size was large, you could split a main between two and just get 2 egg
  fried rice. The sechuan chicken wasn't spicy though, they probably figure the locals and Americans can't take chilli
- [Burrito Loco](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rsNkjggfaRUJU2s68) - good affordable late night burritos and tortilla chips.
  The smaller burrito is only 139kc (£4.80) for 200g, ok for a late night snack while not over eating.
  The grande (large) burrito  is 500g and really big for 179kc (£6.20).
  Ideally there should have been a size in between.
  The tortilla chips are cheaper 40kc when bought with a burrito, 75kc otherwise.
  The mango habanero salsa is spicy and sweet with a 3 chilli rating, and totally worth it.
  The next one down habanero salsa while 2 chillis rating is nowhere near as spicy
- [The Globe Bookstore And Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/X7EFzUvZUxaB35VcA) - touristy bookstore themed cafe with
  American brunch until 12:30pm - fattening. Had the Jumberjack which is half a plate of 3 scrambled eggs, 2 french
  toasts with maple syrup, 2 bacon rashers burnt black, 2 small sausages, and "house fries" which is actually a bunch of
  potato squares fried until your fork can't pierce them. Perhaps a good stodgy breakfast to recover from a night of
  heavy drinking, but you cannot eat this every day. Slow wifi 3/0.4 Mbit/s
- [Palladium](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Hgs1KqvtPVcFec9J6) - central shopping mall with the usual Western brands

<!-- -->

- [Riegrovy Sady](https://maps.app.goo.gl/97rBm3YjG9PUZReJ8) - lovely park with a view
- [Letna Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iLvHHGyjmwxG3FXp7) - another nice park with a view, and the fancy beer garden
  listed above

<!-- -->

- Prague Airport - the food court restaurant is surprisingly reasonably priced and 34kc for a bottle of water is better
  than 50kc at the vending machines in the main terminal lounges

  [here](https://www.menicka.cz/2123-restaurant-matylda.html) for good lunch deals

#### Brno

You only need a couple hours to walk around Brno, some nice architecture, and the usual international brands.

- [Bavard cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8FVSgxANxoSDrEYn8) - eggs benedict with bacon was good and large compared to
  some other places, although at 270kc (£9) this is expensive by local standards

#### České Budějovice

Historic town centre, you only need an hour to walk around it.

- [Esence Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ufQKqYwqNVzjPkGL9) - decent chai latte and serves brunch until 6pm. The
  scrambled eggs were decent, with 3 pieces of bread and a salad with a nice green dressing
- [Samson fountain](https://maps.app.goo.gl/keQ5mquKBD7kyRds5) - the fountain and town square, the main bit you want to
  see
- [Parking Senovážné Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mpEdejhKuix6TafJ7) - only 10kc (£3.50) for 2 hours on Sunday when
  I stopped there, enough time to walk around and have a coffee or brunch.

- [Stromovka Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HXoX4cTCy1zcyDam8) - park if you have time

#### Kutna Hora

Unesco heritage city in the middle of Czechia with impressive cathedral, stopped there driving between Prague and
Wroclaw, Poland.

- [Turistka](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CpeEinY5krxvNM1L7) - gentrified coffee shop near the cathedral, most of the food is
  on the breakfast menu, catch it in the morning if you can
- [Blues Café](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YDow5fkGVqsJsNyy8) - quirky cafe
- [St Barbara's Cathedral](St Barbara's Cathedral) - the main tourist site in the town
- [Church of Saint James](Church of Saint James) - another historic church worth a look
- [Plague column / Morový sloup](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qr1NGVzdXXJy9HSC8) - historic landmark
- [Parkoviště Na Náměti](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1Tq5J6ZVyQe9nq6A8) - free parking (check Parkopedia for others)

#### Hradec Kralove

Nice small city centre with historic centre in the middle of Czechia,
stopped here driving between Prague and Wroclaw, Poland.

- [Šatlava](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iiGzLtmv6Df7b4v99) - upmarket czech restaurants with no menu online (probably
  because if you saw the prices you wouldn't come, ~30% more than czech restaurants in the centre of Prague).
  The mash was excellent, one of the few restaurants to rival my own,
  but the Dutch schnitzel was reconstituted and not worth it, the cucumber tartare and red onion jam were not great
  either - get the classic pork tenderloin schnitzel if you must.
  Next time I would go with the beef rump steak or confit duck (apparently a sizeable portion).
